However, it might be the best of those three. After the bombastic polished production of Destroyer Kiss went on stage with Eddie Kramer recording and belted out a batch of energetic, fun, straight-shooting rockers. In retrospect, it was a magic time when they had the success of Destroyer under their belts but didn't get to excess of the Love Gun/Alive II era. Kind of like surfing a killer wave while it's breaking but hasn't crested yet. Is \"Calling Dr Love\" the greatest Gene Simmons gem in an arsenal full of rock classics? I say yes. Turn that song up to 10 from the opening note and it just blows you away. Dr Love also contains my all-time favorite Ace Frehely guitar solo. Stanley's \"I Want You\" might be the best lead-off track ever. \"Makin Love\" is heavy metal Kiss long before anyone ever heard of Vinnie Vincent. Rock & Roll Over also seems like \"the perfect 70s rock album\" and just has a vibe that can't be denied.\n","\n","Standout tracks: I Want You, Calling Dr. Love, Mr. Speed, See You In Your Dreams, Makin Love\n","Generated Summary: track note overlooked\n","Original Summary: Let Me Go Rock & Roll Over\n","Original Review: Gift\n","Generated Summary: gift\n","Original Summary: Five Stars\n","Original Review: XL really means XL.
