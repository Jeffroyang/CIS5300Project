I understood that they had changed the original design form a tent with a floor that you effectively place on top of the mattress to one with only an elasticated skirt (no floor). The original design doesn't allow for use of your own bottom sheets the newer version does as you stretch it around the mattress.  I received an older version tent with the inbuilt floor and was going to send it back but ended up keeping it as my son was having so much fun just playing with it as a tent on the lining room floor.  I purchased a Tree House version which did come with the elasticated skirt and this is the one we use on his bed.  What I have also ended up using this older style of tent for is as a part of a travel bed system.  It was proved to be great! These things take two minutes to set up and take down and weight next to nothing.  They pack up lovely & small so no issues adding them into your check on luggage. After a five minute set up, voila he has a home form home, familiar sleeping arrangement. We place a travel sleep bed inside, initially we had a Shrunks air bed which was great (until it failed) also a bit noisy when they move around on it.  This year will be the first time my daughter has slept in anything but a porta cot.  We decided to do the same thing for her.  She has a bed tent on her actual bed and LOL I sent for more than one style of Pacific Tents bed tents trying to get one in the older style for travel.  Luckily I found one, Blue Fairy tent and it even has the front zipper.  Spacious & high they can accommodate a toddler sized portable cot bed, kids size air mattress or a Shrunks style air bed.

I've been teaching her about the planets and these are a great learning tool and a hands on way to learn about the planets. After using these a few times, she's able to identify each planet. In the set you get the 8 main planets, Pluto, and a sheet of 200 glow in the dark star/comet stickers. The planets are not exactly to scale, but they are mostly accurate in their sizes relative to each other; for example, Venus and Earth are often called twin planets because they are about the same size and in the set, they are the same size. Also, Jupiter is the largest planet and is the largest in the set.\n","\n","While I think that these make a great teaching tool, there are quite a few things that could use improvement. First of all, the planets are made of flimsy, thin Easter egg plastic, so when my daughter tries to open and close the few planets that open, I'm always worried she's going to crack one of the halves. Also, the center of the entire solar system, the Sun, is NOT included! I find that so disappointing, especially if you are going to hang them from the ceiling and want to create an accurate model of the solar system. The colors of the planets are mainly accurate, although Uranus is an odd purple color with spots, when in reality it is supposed to be a pale blue color. I do like the detailing on some of the planets, such as Jupiter's lines and red spot. I am disappointed in the Saturn planet because the ring will NOT stay on it - it keeps falling off even when I popped open the planet to insert the thin ring around the edges and tried to close it between the two halves.\n","\n","I do like that you can hang these from the ceiling, but in order to do that, the instructions state you have to use adhesive putty or tack the string into the ceiling. Because she may not be interested in these for too long, I chose not to put holes in the ceiling and also because she likes to hold them as we are talking about them. The other selling point of these planets is that they glow in the dark. Based on the item photos, I thought these would glow really bright, but unfortunately, they glow pretty faintly. I also find it disappointing that the planets do not come labeled. Unless the parent is savvy about the solar system, it may be hard for a child to tell which planets are which. Lastly, the stickers that come with it are very cheap and nearly impossible to peel off the sheet! I ended up ripping lots of them in trying to get my nail under the edge to peel it up, so we just threw them away.\n","\n","It seems as though there are more cons than pros to this set quality wise,  but my daughter does love it and they make the planets more real to her than just looking at pictures of them.\n","Stage 1 summary: I've been teaching her about the planets and these are a great learning tool and a hands on way to learn about the planets.

That said, if your child hasn't internalized the necessity of learning anything about ancient civilizations, this game isn't fun enough to overcome that.  This game works only with kids who are not kicking and screaming, but rather realize the alternative introduction to these things would be far less interactive and far more dull.\n","\n","For the first game or two, my advice for starting with kids who don't yet have a burning curiosity about ancient civilizations is to begin playing with only half the deck.

I knew from Amazon that it was a bestselling game and thought it looked fun.  I ended up not buying it because I had the impression that it was just a kids version of Scrabble and didn't think my kids were old enough to understand how to play.\n","\n","My observant husband ended up purchasing this game for me for Christmas.  We soon discovered that our assumptions about this game were way off!\n","\n","The game consists of letter tiles which come inside a cloth banana.  A clever and cute way to store the pieces!  I love it!...the banana case makes this game very portable.  We bring it with us on vacation, to restaurants, camping, etc.\n","\n","Players start the game with 21 tiles.  You must arrange your tiles into words - but they have to connect like in a crossword puzzle/scrabble.  The first player to use up their tiles shouts out \"Peel\" and all players take another tile.  Maybe the person who called out \"Peel\" drew an easy letter and can place it in his crossword immediately...like drawing an S and putting it at the end of an existing word on his puzzle.  Or maybe that person got a difficult letter to add on, like X, so now he has to disassemble his crossword and remake it to include a word with an X. This gives the other players a chance to catch up, and someone else may be first to call out \"Peel.\"  You can continually change and rearrange your crossword as much as you want.  Game continues in this manner until there are no more tiles in the draw pile.  At that point the first person to use up their tiles and calls out \"Bananas!\" wins.\n","\n","My husband does NOT like playing word games with me because I usually win and he ends up not having any fun.  This is why Scrabble and Boggle have been collecting dust on the shelf. To my suprise, he enjoys playing Bananagrams. I think it's because this game does not require you to be a word junkie.  In fact, it's the opposite! It's actually easier to win if you make short little words.  Case in point - it's a lot easier to turn the word Tap into Tape if you draw an E, or into Tarp if you draw an R, and so on.  Whereas if you make a big word, you usually can't add or drop a letter from it.  This game keeps you on your toes!  You have to be able to see opportunities to change words quickly without having to rearrange your entire crossword.\n","\n","My whole family plays this game - myself, husband, 8 year old, and 6 year old.  My 8 year old does suprisingly well creating his own crossword, and my 6 year old just works on creating words without having to put them into a crossword.  It's easy to create your own set of rules for younger players.\n","\n","After watching us play, the grandparents (who are avid crossword lovers) were intrigued and wanted to try.  They quickly caught on and had a blast playing!\n","\n","A lot easier, funner, and faster to play then Scrabble.  No waiting around for someone to decide what word they want to play and where they want to play it.  No point tiles to worry about.  A lot less stressful!  This game gets two big thumbs up from our family!\n","Stage 1 summary: You must arrange your tiles into words - but they have to connect like in a crossword puzzle/scrabble.

I decided to shop around, and found this nifty box just sitting on the shelf at my local game store.  Since we had a group that were willing to try a Tabletop RPG system, but had never had any experience, I decided to buy it as an alternative to the divisive 4th Edition rule set.\n","\n","This is not a comparison of the actual full systems of D&D 4th Edition and Pathfinder, but instead, just a comparison about what comes in the actual beginner's editions: the Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition Starter Set (or the Red Box) and the Pathfinder Beginner's Box.\n","\n","Let's compare the two in each of the basic categories:\n","\n","BEGINNER'S GUIDE\n","\n","4th Edition: A 32-page manual stapled together on magazine-grade paper.  This is less a player's manual than it is a long, single-player choose-your-own-adventure.  Some of the rules that one needs to know in order to play 4th Edition are included here, including picking a race and a class, as well as how to roll attacks, but they are casually thrown in during the descriptions of the sample adventure.  There are no core rules really listed here, and anyone that would need to quickly roll up a character, research basic attack maneuvers, or find a description of gear, spells, or other abilities is going to be out of luck.  None of these basic functions are anywhere to be found in these 32 pages.  While a 32-page adventure sounds like a lot of fun, the adventure lacks a real storytelling hook, as most of the backstory and plot is required to come from the player's imagination alone.  Frustratingly little context is given by the guide itself.  Plus, the guide separates each scenario four ways for each core class (Fighter, Rogue, Wizard, Cleric), so you're only really playing through an 8 page adventure with very few branched paths.  All in all, the book intrigues a new player well enough to stay interested, but as a guidebook, it fails.  Once you've read it once and \"created\" a character, you'll never want to touch it again (unless you're forced to play through the whole thing again in order to create another character, which you will not want to do).  Overall, 4/10.\n","\n","Pathfinder: A 64-page fully-bounded book with high-grade, full-color pages.  Like the Starter Set, this also includes a single-player choose-your-own adventure.  However, this only encompasses the first eight pages, as opposed to the entire 32 page-booklet of 4E.  You can only play through the adventure as a basic fighter (as opposed to branching off so you can play a variety of classes) but this turns out to be an asset here.  As a first-time player, you are actually told a story, one of a simple citizen from a town called Sandpoint called forth from the mayor to stop a menacing foe that is lurking in a dungeon.  You learn the basics of rolling dice for attacks and skill checks, and encounter some dangerous traps and a formidable final foe.  It's a simple scenario that actually hooks you in with a little bit of adrenaline.  Shakespeare it's not, but it definitely hooks the reader to learn more.\n","\n","Fortunately, the last three-quarters of the book actually functions as a real player's guide, including the basics on how to choose a class, roll up attributes, figuring out ability modifiers, choosing feats and spells, buying weapons and other gear, and learning the basics of combat maneuvers and other functions a beginning player will need to know once they begin a game.  You could have someone read the Hero's Handbook and they would be ready to enter a full game of Pathfinder, save for not knowing a few of the more advanced rules that could be picked up on the fly.  The art styles are bright and vivid with high-quality artwork, and the writing style is equally compelling.  Overall, the Hero's Handbook is a solid resource even after a player has upgraded to the full Pathfinder Core Rulebook.  Overall, I'd give this book a 9/10.\n","\n","THE GAME MASTER'S/DUNGEON MASTER'S GUIDE\n","\n","D&D 4th Edition: A 64-page manual that is the same flimsy quality as the Player's Guide.  Again, this doesn't really function as a guide book as much as it does an adventure that you're supposed to learn as you play.  However, instead of trying to tell a story or investigate a full dungeon, it is instead just a series of battle encounters, separated in a way that feels devoid of a cohesive experience.  You'll see an example of how all of the player character's and enemies' pawns are laid out on the map, and then a description of how a battle between these two groups are supposed to play out.  You are intended to play through the encounter, and then start over with a different encounter with different enemies, learning a new basic combat maneuver.  While this might be interesting to battle game strategists, there is no \"Role Playing\" here: no storytelling, no character development, nothing that makes you feel like you're actually part of the adventure aside from fighting enemies.  Plus, this does again not function as a resourceful guidebook, as once you play through it once, you'll never need it again.  There are no tools here for an aspiring dungeon master to craft their own dungeon, stories, NPCs, campaign setting, or any other tool necessary to keep playing after this first adventure.  Your only choice is to play through the same encounters again, or shell out more money for the more advanced products, which will make this box seem redundant.  I would rate this a 3/10.\n","\n","Pathfinder Beginner's Box: A 100-page fully bounded book on high-quality paper.  As with the Hero's Handbook, the bulk of this manual consists of a full array of tips and tricks on how to become a good game master, with advice on how to create your own stories, battles, and various other scenarios, as well as descriptions of enemies and specialty items galore, with a few advanced rules that are important for an experienced GM to be aware of.  However, for anyone that doesn't want to have to deal with any of that nonsense to play a simple session, the manual opens with a mini-module, an adventure with a back story and plot hook that tells of a menacing force killing off local livestock; the players investigate a nearby dungeon to find the source of these disruptions.  The game master gets a full ten-room dungeon to have the players explore, and there are a variety of enemy encounters and traps that will use the quick thinking of the players in order to resolve in the best possible way.  It's a well rounded experience that will use the talents of all of the classes in order to best the system and make it to the end.  More importantly, it's fun, and that's the whole reason we're playing this, isn't it?  Again, the manual manages to best the 4th Edition Dungeon Master's guide at what it attempted to do, while still being a resource that actually teaches you the full game.  This gets a 10/10.\n","\n","MAPS/PAWNS\n","\n","D&D 4th Edition: The maps that are used for the dungeon are made of folded up paper that is separated into different sections (each section sets up a different encounter).  While the paper looks nice enough, it's not something you're going to be able to reuse after the game is over, and it's really only printed to be a use-once-and-discard kind of item.  The pawns here are circular pieces of cardboard that are multisided, so that once you flip a pawn over, it represents a different character.  If you're setting up a new encounter, you will find yourself in a position where you must choose between two different enemies simply because they both take up real estate on the same avatar.  When playing the game, you are simply looking at a bunch of miniature coins set along a flimsy piece of paper.  You do get access to a bunch of playing cards (think Magic: The Gathering) with spells and abilities listed in detail on them.  While these are an appreciated touch, that they are needed at all makes the combat system seem overly complicated, and less like traditional D&D than a different game.  Overall: 5/10\n","\n","Pathfinder Beginner's Box: The box contains one 20\" x 30\" flip map.  One side contains a fully rendered dungeon to go with the sample module in the Game Master's Guide, while the other side is a blank, beige mat that can be used with a dry-erase marker to make your own dungeon.  You could also use this side for general battles or other encounters.  The great thing about this flip map is that it's pretty impervious to dry-erase markers, tape, window markers, or any other device that you might want to use to hide portions of the dungeon or make adjustments as seen fit (My suggestion is to use Glass Chalk or a similar window marker to cover up the full map, using a washcloth and Windex to \"reveal\" new areas when the players explore them...post-it notes or taped construction paper could provide a similar function).  The pawns are impressive, as they are double-sided figures that stand up.  Not quite as satisfying as plastic miniatures, but are a lot more dynamic and decipherable than the tiny coardboard coins that come with the 4E set.  The pawns are also numerous, with approximately three times as many options than the D&D set.  Overall: 8/10\n","\n","DICE\n","\n","4th Edition: A set of 6 black dice, including one of each die (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20).\n","Pathfinder: A set of 7 red dice, the above six and one 00-90 ten sided die for easy percentage roles.\n","\n","CHARACTER SHEETS\n","\n","4th Edition: A handful of single page character sheets that use a simplified ruleset than the actual 4E one.\n","Pathfinder: A similar number of double paged character sheets, with listed skills, as well as plenty of room for spells, equipment, and abilities.  Also included a four pregenerated character sheets, containing two double sided pages that describe the basic functions and options for each character.  This makes it even easier to just jump into a game, even when a couple players don't know all of the rules yet.\n","\n","DOWNLOADABLE ADD-ONS\n","\n","4th Edition: A single \"adventure encounter\" that consists of an all-too-brief setup and single battle.  While this is, from a storytelling standpoint, a step-up from the basic Red Box books, it still has no real value from a role-playing standpoint.\n","Pathfinder: Four downloadable expansions: (1) A \"Beginner Box Player Kit\", which gives the setup to a fifth class (the Barbarian, in addition to the Cleric, Fighter, Rogue, and Wizard already included), plus other tips and other rules left out of the basics in the main manual; (2) \"Beginner Box GM Kit\", which contains a second adventure that, while not as good as the included one, is nice to have on hand for free, as well as some other general useful information; (3) \"Beginner Box Bash Demos\", which is a series of mini-adventures that are usable in extending a campaign with those that want more value out of their basic kit; (4) \"Pathfinder Society Character Creation Guide\", which includes basic rules to create a Pathfinder character usable at an official Pathfinder event.\n","\n","In every single category, the Pathfinder box clearly trumps the D&D 4th Edition set, with the lone exception of price.  I hate to say it, but this is another example of \"you get what you pay for\", as when you buy the Pathfinder Beginner's Box, you'll still likely find use in the two guidebooks, flip-mat, and pawn-figures for months to come, if not longer.  If you give the Beginner Box to a couple of 12 year old boys, they may be able to entertain themselves through many play sessions with only what's included in the box.  If you bought them the 4th Edition Red Box, they would likely be amused for a few hours before either becoming bored or clammoring for the next product in the D&D essentials line (the more expensive Dungeon Master's Kit).\n","\n","I heartily endorse the Pathfinder Beginner Box.  I actually bought a second one, just for the reference material and extra pawns alone.  If you're brand new to RPGs, this is a great place to start.\n","Stage 1 summary: None of these basic functions are anywhere to be found in these 32 pages.

He's so busy and active, but the minute a puzzle comes out he is determined and focused. I have bought many puzzles and have found Melissa and Doug makes the best puzzles, this one being no exception. Here are a few thoughts:\n","\n","-Pieces: These pieces are large, sturdy and fit together well. I've found that cheaper puzzles have pieces that don't slide together easily or they come slightly bent so they come undone with barely any movement. These pieces are thicker than standard, so they slide together and stay there. With other brands sometimes my son will have the piece in the right place, but since they either are too hard to put together or don't slide together easily he'll think it's not right and put the piece back. He doesn't have that problem at all with these. The puzzle pieces are also finished with the shiny material on both sides, meaning it's not straight brown cardboard on the bottom. This is definitely a sign of a little better quality!\n","-Design: My son is obsessed with trucks, fire trucks are towards the top of his favorites (right after diggers and school buses). This was done very nicely. The puzzle basically has three horizontal rows, except where the wheels are, there's an  extra piece deep there. It makes it easy to work on it systematically, top down, bottom up or side to side. It has some nice cues to help, such as the green stripe on the bottom, the rope in the middle pieces and the pipes on top. My son just turned 3 and can do this puzzle by himself (if I sit down with him and encourage him to continue when he gets frustrated).\n","-Size: For some reason have a giant puzzle definitely adds to the cool factor. It just looks awesome when it's finished!\n","\n","Overall, I highly, highly recommend this puzzle. It's one that should last for a long time and definitely holds my sons attention.

My dad used to play this an super mario brothers all the time and so did i later on. Although i never got to beating this game (got bored after beating level 5), its still very fun to play. The only thing i hated about the game was not the challenge, but when you almost die and your life meter beeping like hell. This is my most favorite zelda game because its the only one where it really doesnt tell you where to go next. What i mean by this is after you beat a temple, someone or something doesnt say anything on the next location but don't worry, each temple you enter says what level it is so you know if your supposed to beat it or not *ex: i beat level 1 an 2 but then i find level 6. I turn back because i never beat level 4 an 5 to aquire the certain items in those temples in order to get past level 6*. There are also caves containing townsfolk where you buy valuable items, information, or free info and tasks. Now, thats just the underworld part, the overworld is a huge map with areas like forests, mountains and such with monsters, caves, temples (levels), and secrets all over the land and like i said, i like this zelda game the most because you always got to figure out where to go next which can take longer than you think if you don't use and guides or FAQS. And thats more than half of the game; wandering in circles, solving mysteries to get to the next location, searching for upgraded items such as swords or boomerangs, finding temples, caves, defeating bosses in temples with each boss having its own stragety where you need to figure out its weakness by using countless items on it. Then after you beat the 8 temples and collect the 8 triforce pieces, you can finally enter ganons lair and save the princess Zelda in this fantasy adventure of endless fun.\n","Stage 1 summary: I've grown up with an nes even though im 12.

What those people left out is that the game they're playing is fun, which makes them want to play it for 100 hours. Donkey Kong 64 has its moments, but I don't think it's fun enough to really finish 100%.. or at all. I played and loved all three Donkey Kong Country games back in the day, and I was pretty surprised that there was an N64 Donkey Kong title of which I'd never heard. But this isn't a Donkey Kong platformer: it's a mini-game marathon. It's like Mario Party, except not half as fun.\n","\n","Let's start with the monkeys, which are arguably the title's greatest fault. You never, or at least I never, really felt like you're in control of an agile primate. These Kongs move far too slowly. You \"run\" in much the same manner that N64 Link does (rolling). But Link moves way faster than these monkeys, and and you might find yourself screaming, \"Oh would you just get to the warp point already!\" Furthermore, the jumping ability of Kongs in 3D space seems to be less than polished. They won't get you killed, as this game is ridiculously easy (in terms of staying alive). However, they will annoy you as big Kremlins knock you off ledges because your monkeys can't move like monkeys. Now imagine bad controls coupled knocking you off ledges with being forced to barrel roll back at 50% OoT Link's rolling speed.\n","\n","All too often, Rare's solution to hiding 200 Golden Bananas throughout the game seems to be 'toss in a mini-game'. Some of them are fun, but these mini-games bring the term 'Wii Play' to mind, and that's a phrase I'm sure Cranky Kong wouldn't want to be associated with.\n","\n","They want you to play with each character once in every level. This wouldn't be a bad idea if the platforming controls were better and there were a decent number of enemies to fight (outside of those two or three bonus levels). But if you want to get everything, you need to barrel roll through each level five times, killing the one or two enemies that oppose you, and exploring for the spots where Rare wants to launch a mini-game. Two of the mini-games were the original 8-bit Donkey Kong and Jetpac. They're easily the best parts of this game.\n","\n","I got bored with it going through the water level with 80 or so Bananas.

If you're a fan of the classic version of trivial pursuit, it's faithfully reproduced here but if you're looking for something different, you are going to love the blown out style of game play in Unhinged mode.  Actually, there are three play modes consisting of Classic, Unhinged, and Flash Mode (a trivia race up a ladder for multiple players).\n","Classic and Flash modes are pretty straightforward but forget everything you know or think you know (almost) when playing Unhinged mode.  The game board itself, graphics and all, are totally transformed and offer new spaces which include Board Rotation, Teleport, Random Category, 50/50, Recycling, Sticky, Bounce, Double/Triple Bonus Points, and All-Wedge.  And if that isn't enough, you earn bonus points to purchase special moves and you can also place bets in regards to the outcome of your opponent answering questions correctly or incorrectly.\n","Not content with reading the trivia questions yourself?  No problem.  Celebrity voices do it for you.  Here's your supporting cast and the categories they read from:  Whoopi Goldberg on Arts & Entertainment, Terry Bradshaw on Sports & Leisure, John Ratzenberger covers the Wild Card category, Brooke Burke hits you with People & Places, Bill Nye (the Science Guy) is all over the Science & Nature topic, and John Cleese reads the History questions.  Also adding to the fun is a sizable amount of multimedia clues interspersed with the regular questions.\n","After only a couple of hours of play time, this game becomes seriously addictive and really tests your trivia knowledge.  Not too hard and not too easy and very entertaining for sure.  A great game for one and all and recommended to everyone.\n","Stage 1 summary: Celebrity voices do it for you.

To play the game you have to pay $9.99 a month. The  graphics are very good, especially the enviroments, and actually  contradictly to other people I thought the graphics on the characters were  pretty good. Anyways this game has a lotta strong points over other on-line  RPG's, for one, YOU CAN ACTUALLY BUY ARMOR AND WEAPONS FROM SHOPS AT A  REASONABLE PRICE! Something that EQ (everquest) failed to do as it was  Impossible to buy the 3000 plat bracers or whatever it was, and you ended  up having to buy everything from players. What I didn't like about Asherons  Call was that there was no music. The monsters wore thin, and became  dislikable. Also,like on  UO (ultima online), you have to have certain  spell components to cast spells, I really hate that. All in All the whole  reason I quit Asheron's call was not because it wasn't fun, but because I  didn't wanna pay 9.99 a month for that little bit of fun.\n","Stage 1 summary: What I didn't like about Asherons  Call was that there was no music.

This was not a pc game but a poorly executed console port.  If I wanted to play a console game, I would have bought the console version.  But, to get a console version that plays on the computer, well, is insulting.  As others have written, there is no mouse support.  I could live with that, if the interface was easy to use.  This interface attempts to be cool, which only leads it to being difficult and not at all intuitive.\n","Often you get to a place and have no idea how to do what you want.  The help key is not very helpful, either. Without a mouse, it is hard to find what you want, or to get out of the wrong place, that you will find yourself often.  I felt insulted by this game.\n","I should have listened to the reviews that downgraded the game.  I actually found the play at times fun, but the game crashed 2x out of 3 games.  Not good. That it crashed during the only enjoyable game I had, well, was not reasuring.  The addition of new pitch types was a good change.  The circles to assist fielding are WAY to large and intrusive.  The game often required six or more imputs to get it to accept the pitch selection.  (Yes, my sidewinder was calibrated, and works fine with other games.)  This totally interrupts the flow of the game, and is very frustrating.  The player graphics look like they were taken from an arcade game and not as realistic as some past versions.  Some of the animations are really entertaining.\n","Overall, I was very disappointed.  Getting a console game, wrapped in a pc package to me is unethical.  The menus are flat out awful.

Because of it's difficult programing nature, and it's lack of memory, RPG's were non-existant save for Quest 64. But with the Gamecube hot and ready, RPG's are finally slowly coming back!\n","To be truthfull, this really isn't so much an RPG as it is an adventure game. You pick one of 4 characters (each with special magical powers) and set upon a series of battles facing hundreds of foes. It's a very simple concept with easy controls, but one will soon realize how hard it is to master. Not only do you have to make sure you are ok throught the countless levels, but you must watch over your allies. If they get surrouned by enemies you have to go help them out or they might be killed. Likewise if they retreat to replenish their energy you have to make sure they have a clear path to their base.\n","The graphics are amazing, and the frame rate is quite high, giving many rich enviroments with lots of areas to explore. One of the coolest features is the Multi-play which allows for up to 4 people to participate in an epic battle. It is loads of fun with human companions rather than computer ones (though those can be fun too)\n","The only thing this game is lacking is it's acting. The voice acting us just downright horrible. There is a \"story\" mode, which explains WHY you are at these different battles, but the acting is so bad and the plot so [bad] that you just dont' care and skip it. One of the worse cliche lines in the game is \"be afraid, be very afraid.\"\n","That aside, this game is very well designed.

Aboard the spacecraft is a young enigma possessing the horrid awareness of a great forthcoming catastrophe.  Sent as an emissary, Meredy must prevent her home planet, Celestia, from fatally colliding with the planet Inferia.  Witnessing the monstrous projectile disembark close to their village, two dear friends, Reid and Furrah, futilely attempt to communicate with the visitor. Unable to comprehend the intensions of Meredy, nearby villagers banish the stranger.  Concerned and up to the brim of gallantry, Reid and Furrah agree to voyage with the gate-crasher and what they least expect is a crusade to (as with all RPG's) eventually defend their world.  Namco's third installment to the Tales of Destiny series is definitely a stalwart one, yet not as enticing as the closely nonexistent PlayStation can truthfully offer (i.e., Metal Gear, Final Fantasy VII).  What seems as a slack-jawing quest only passes up as a sluggish and dreadfully predictable one.\n","Reintroducing the RPG's most inventive feature, Real-time clashing, Namco's latest can only go so far with one great area, the fighting engine, where the other departments hurtle in a downward spiral.  Tweaking and ameliorating flaws found in the prequel, Namco has decided to discard the round 1 fighting found in the prequel, allowing the player to manage one character in real time fashion as the computer takes control of the other three.  The battle encounters are generally fast-paced, even though at times the computer on your side typically performs useless moves like casting an ineffectual spell or two.  The enjoyable customizable setups and minigames are unsuccessful to deeply facilitate the game's shabbiness.  Mildly enhanced, the RPG is a hollow shell when compared to current RPG standards.  Thrown in are the repetitive mundane phase; random battles, level gaining, overly exaggerated bosses, traveling from town to town, and recruiting seasoned allies along the way.  Although knocking the crap outta the enemies in fighter-like style is fantastic, the game's lagging story is a hideous monstrosity.\n","\n","Revolving in old-school 2D and characters textured in brightly rendered sprites, Tales of Destiny 2 appears as if it were one of the more earlier PlayStation games.  The overview world is done in a scruffy, reduced landscape and lacks the punch to impress anyone who owns any next-gen system.  Heroes in the battle engine are garishly tinted with a fine coat of colors.  Monsters, usually in a goop of bizarre, cutesy outfits, get quite annoying with their harmless forms.  On the contrast to the fluid colors, it really goes along with the simplicity of the game.  The musical score is nothing to brag about, delivering dull, monotonous sounds.  Plagued with many inescapable flaws, the game couldn't possibly lower its status but does with terrible voice acting.  The spoken dialogue seems to be a bunch of scrambled, unrehearsed lines.\n","All-in-all Tales of Destiny 2 stirs up as habitual as your daily brew.  Failing to furnish the life span of the PlayStation, I wouldn't recommend to shell out money for this unpleasing RPG.  With Final Fantasy X looming closer and presently released in Japan, Namco should have been more on the highbrow and pulled this one off as a revolutionary title on the PlayStation 2.  Mediocre games like these further indicate how the PlayStation should take its concluding vacation.\n","Stage 1 summary: Heroes in the battle engine are garishly tinted with a fine coat of colors.

Since then, I've been far too busy to review anything, until I  solved it last night.  \"Fallout\" is just the trainer for the big  one!\n","\"Fallout 2\" uses the same engine as the original, and was easy to  slip into, since the commands were all familiar, but because the initial  release is notoriously buggy, make sure you install the patch before you  start.  Set 80 years after the events in \"Fallout\", your character is a  descendent of the Vault Dweller who, with some refugees, had established a  village far to the north when expelled after saving Vault 13.  Over the  years, village life had become increasingly tribal and memories of Vault 13  had slipped into the murky realms of mystical memory.  Drought had set in,  crops failed, children and cattle were starving when a chance viewing of an  old holotape revealed the existence Vault 13's Garden of Eden Creation Kit  (G.E.C.K.) - just what was needed for a bountiful existence.  After  surviving a difficult test, your character, the Chosen One, is sent off,  with few skills and little equipment, to locate the Holy Vault 13 and  return with the G.E.C.K.  Of course, it is not quite as easy as that, as  you gradually find out the Master in \"Fallout\" was a pussycat compared to  your ultimate opponents.\n","This is definitely a game for mature people who  can laugh at themselves - sex (straight and gay) and drugs play a major  part in the story line.  There are twists and turns that will have you  falling about laughing, and some repellent attitudes that will sicken you.  You have to lie, cheat, steal and fight your way through pretty nasty  scenes, and delicately negotiate your way through others.  Good deeds are  rewarded (if you help out Frank in the Den, go back and visit him later  when he's made good - his generosity is a huge help), and bad decisions are  paid for (leave that Pariah dog to his own fate).  There are quite a few  chance encounters, some screamingly funny (especially for fans of Monty  Python, Star Trek, etc.) and, for a basically moral character, some pretty  distressing, where you are completely powerless. And though it's pretty  gory, nothing's funnier than the way some of these critters fly apart after  a good critical hit.\n","\"Fallout 2\" is a much larger game than the original,  and to make traversing the vast distances easier, after several quests you  actually get - wait for it - a car!  Many differently skilled NPCs are  eager to join you; how many you can have in your party depends on your  charisma.  Where you had little control over NPCs in your party in  \"Fallout\", in \"Fallout 2\" you can get them to wear improved armour, select  better weapons, and they sometimes actually increase their skills when your  character levels.  I developed a tight little bunch, consisting of the  loyal Sulik (give him a SuperSledge and watch him go!) and Vic (whose  Repair skill is essential until yours is developed, if you can tolerate his  sucking up and constant whining about Sulik), Cassidy (much better with  weapons than your character when you find him) and after I solved all his  town's problems, Marcus the Mutant, entertainingly voiced by Michael Dorn  (Worf from Star Trek).  Hint: if you do have Marcus join, take his minigun  away before he shreds your entire party and give him a more focussed  weapon, but he is very picky.\n","The great thing about this game is that it  is non-linear, and you can switch between good or evil as the whim takes  you.  However, it became evident after quite some playing time that I had  not developed my initial character's attributes or skills in the direction  I wanted to take, so with the knowledge gained, I started again with a  character who relied less on strength and endurance, but was more  intelligent and perceptive (but not too weak, as some of the best perks  have minimum requirements).  This tradeoff made the initial stages very  difficult, but really paid off later.  Choosing three Tag skills was hard -  scientific skills, both medical and technological, were more important than  some combat skills, and quickly developed thievery skills were essential,  as everything was so expensive, but these were useless without good  weapons, negotiation and survival skills.  A thorough reading of the  excellent, spiral-bound (yippee!) manual before developing your character  really saves a lot of time.  And watch the wonderful introductory scenes  for a lot of clues.\n","My advice to adults who love RPGs is to forget the  quasi-medieval, sword and sorcery worlds and get into the post-apocalyptic  life of sex, drugs and great big guns as soon as you can!\n","Stage 1 summary: This is definitely a game for mature people who  can laugh at themselves - sex (straight and gay) and drugs play a major  part in the story line.

If you're expecting any of the competitive combat and trademark moves that you'd expect from the franchise, you will be disappointed. However, what we get in return is a creative, surrealistic platformer that I can honestly say is like none other.\n","\n","The only connection I can see with this game to the Street Fighter franchise is that the protagonist's name is Ken. That's it, even the US release of Ninja Gaiden tied in closer to Street Fighter (protagonist is Ryu and his father is Ken). Let's pretend this has a different title that pops up in your head and forget that this has any connection to Street Fighter whatsoever and move on from there.\n","\n","Anyways, you play throughout 5 planets to track down the antagonist. The controls are fairly simple for a platformer game, featuring A to jump and B to shoot projectile beams at enemies. It does have a MegaMan vibe to it (then again, Capcom developed this game), but it still holds it own by having Ken climb on the walls, which is necessary for a good amount of the levels in this game. When it comes to attacking, it works well but it's absolutely worth it to collect the power ups in this game. Whether they'd come from destroyed enemies or rock-like objects scattered around, they'll make everything easier. Despite this, the shooting is still a bit unorthodox. Jumping and shooting is limited, so it's best to attack while either on the ground or clinging onto a wall. What may confuse people the most, however, is shooting diagonally up, which is done by pressing down on the D-Pad and B. Yes, it takes quite a while to nail it down, but it's far from the worst control scheme I've dealt with in gaming, so it's nothing too serious.\n","\n","The level design is what I feel makes this game so great. No two levels are alike, and even though the main objective of each stage is to destroy enough enemies to activate the portal, Capcom know how to make it very interesting in the process. Strategy and perseverance is a must, especially during the final stage when it comes down to speed being a critical factor (200 seconds to defeat 5 bosses). It's a challenge that can be frustrating but it doesn't skimp out on the fun factor at all.\n","\n","It may not be Street Fighter at heart, but it's a great game for the NES regardless. Even with its flaws, it rounds out for a great game that will highly appeal to those that like the platforming and side scrolling genres. It's a unorthodox and varied attempt at this style, and it works very well.\n","Stage 1 summary: The level design is what I feel makes this game so great.

This wouldn't be bad, but that brings me to the second problem. There is no loading bar, so you can't see how much longer it's gonna be. Plus, while you are waiting for it to load, this annoying alarm type noise plays. Now, put all that together and imagine sitting there for a minute not knowing how much longer they are gonna torture you with that annoying noise. This prevented me from beating the game because I refused to wait for the loading screen. I have heard that the gamecube version is much better with the load times, although I wouldn't know because I didn't want to buy the same game for two systems. Definately buy this game if you are a Crash Bandicoot fan, but I reccommend the GCN version instead of the PS2 version.\n","Stage 1 summary: This is an excellent game gameplay wise.

However, while this is a nearly exact port of the PC original, that is both good and bad.  First off, the frame rate is rather sluggish.  When there is a lot of on screen action, the framerate becomes slow and choppy, the same problem the Super Nintendo version of the game had years ago.  Second of all, Wolfenstein 3-D will go vastly unappreciated by younger gamers more used to the Quake series or Half-Life.  However, there are a lot of good qualities: the Nazi schwastikas are left intact from the original (which is probably why the game is really rated mature because there isn't much blood at all), and the small amounts of blood are kept red, not a different color as in the GBA version of Doom.  All in all, the GBA version of Wolfenstein 3-D isn't bad at all, but with other first person shooters for the GBA like Doom, Eecks VS Sever, and the upcoming Duke Nukem 3-D and Medal of Honor, you should hold on to your money unless you really love this game.\n","Stage 1 summary: However, while this is a nearly exact port of the PC original, that is both good and bad.

It has lovable characters, a wonderful plot, romance, and tons of rebellion.  The game play is not the button mashing type.  It involves a ton of strategy without being like Warcraft.  Each character that is in the battle takes turns attacking targets.  You can switch out characters based on ability or level.  For those of you who like to button mash, don't count this one out.  I almost did and almost missed out on something great.  It is totally worth it to try.  I have only played this game once, but that is because I finished it within the last six months for the first time, and it takes roughly 60-70 hours to complete.

NOW, WHEN WILL THEY REALEASE DAYTONA USA & AFTER BURNER ON XBOX?  this game is a lot of fun. it is not hard like gt3; it gives you something kind of like the kudos sytem in project gotham. in other words, sega has given race fans the best of both worlds and it is great. in a recent review i said the z06 was awesome but i recently unlocked the CASPITA. this thing looks like an ferrari f-50, moves like the wind, handles like an f-1 racer. i have tried other cars but i can't stop driving the CASPITA. the ford gt-40 is great just like they claim but lets get serious. the CASPITA IS THE CAR YOU WANT WHEN YOU WANT A CAR THAT CAN MATCH YOUR RACING SKILLS. YOU WON'T TAKE THE LEAD RIGHT OFF HAND BUT WHEN YOU GET GOING AND HAVE MASTERED THE TRACKS WITH THE CASPITA AND HAVE WENT THROUGH ALL THE UPGRADES TO A SUPER CAR, I WILL GUARANTEE THAT YOU CAN WIN EVERY RACE EXCEPT \"DRAG RACING\" AND \"RALLY RACING\" IN FIRST PLACE. DON'T BELIEVE ME? JUST PUT IN THE TIME TO EARN THE CASPITA AND UPGRADE IT TO A SUPER CAR, THEN PUT IT ON THE FINAL STAGE IN \"WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP\" OFFICIAL RACES AGAINST THE DODGE VIPER GTS-R. in my opinion, the CASPITA is the second coming of the FERRARI F-50.\n","Stage 1 summary: project gotham is great but after playing sega gt 2002 this game is a lot of fun. in other words, sega has given race fans the best of both worlds and it is great.\n","Generated summary: great game\n","Actual Summary:project gotham is great but sega gt 2002 is my favorite\n","\n","\n","Review: There aren't enough good turn-based games out there, but there is at least one that is superior: \"Age of Wonders 2\".  I found this game to be as challenging, enjoyable, and addictive as my favorite turn-based games of all time: \"Civilization\" and \"Colonization\".  It has the perfect blend of economics, empire-building, advancement, and fighting that you need to make a great game.\n","Most strategy games of this type don't offer much in the way of tactics.  Battles are usually somewhat simple affairs that you don't have much control over.  One of the special features that AoW2 has is that you get to play out battles on the battlefield.  When a big army of yours tries to capture a city, for example, the view switches to a blow-up of the city, and you command your units one-by-one.  The battles are a lot of fun to play out, but you can put them on automatic if you get tired of them.  Different units have different strengths and weaknesses, and advantages in certain situations. For instance, when I am attacking an enemy wizard's castle, I have my cannons smash the gate, and then send in the cavalry to race right to the wizard and take him out.  Once you figure out how to conduct your units in battle well, you can formulate a high-level strategy for winning them.  That is what makes this game such a rare perfect blend of strategy and tactics.\n","The game is somewhat complicated, but it is not tedious because of it.  You can pick up general concepts and strategies and then dig deeper after that.  That is why AoW2 is such a perfect mix of complexity and playability.  The interface could use more hot keys, but other than that, it is great and it makes the game managable.\n","The game's fantasy setting is very well done.  There are a lot of different races, and although some units are somewhat redundant, every race has at least one or two unique units that make it special.  The maps are beautifully decked out in bright colors, and they never get redundant.  That is saying a lot, since the single-player campaign has 20 big ones.  The wizard portraits look great as well, but the units are kind of small and lacking in detail.  The game doesn't look quite as pretty as say,Warcraft 3, but it still looks good.\n","Diplomacy is a somewhat weak link in \"Age of Wonders 2\", since most of your missions involve defeating one or more wizards, and diplomacy is almost pointless.  That's about the only fault that I find in this outstanding game.  If you are like me and you have been searching for that great turn-based strategy game, then look no further.  Prepare for some sleep deprivation, and break out the Doritos: you're going to need them.\n","Stage 1 summary: It has the perfect blend of economics, empire-building, advancement, and fighting that you need to make a great game.

Even a rental isn't quite warranted.  Actually, the best way to experience Burnout is to stop by a friend's house when he's rented (or bought) it.  If you drive just one lap of a race, you get the idea.  There's really not that much more to get out of it.  With games increasingly being measured by the hours of original play that they offer, this is really quite pathetic.\n","The idea is appealing to anyone who lives in a metropolitan area and has to hassle with traffic--just plow through the congestion and buzz on.  However, the execution of the game is so half-arsed that even young children will lose interest after a few heats.  Get more points by sliding around corners?  Who cares?  Drive head-on into traffic to get a bonus speed burst?  Even this is dull in Burnout.  The replays are very choppy, as well; the pavement looks about as believable as it would if you were to try to pass a glass of milk off as the Statue of Liberty.\n","It seems that the next ingenious move by some bright developer is going to involve melding the possibilities of this game with the spot-on craftsmanship of the Gran Turismo series.  Let's invoke crashes on the highway at 150 mph...let's see some damage on the cars where it happens...let's have a suped-up racing engine that tears through the suburbs and plows down small families...Wheeeee!  Unfortunately, Grand Theft Auto 3 has already done this, so don't get all in to a tither like you do.\n","If someone wants to make just a racer interesting for me after something as satisfying as GTA 3, though, they're going to have to do better than Burnout.

How exciting! Or maybe not so exciting.\n","\n","The re-make promised many things, and did deliver to some certain extent. However there are some things that make me rather agitated, and other things that make me downright mad.\n","\n","DIALOGUE - While much better than the original, it still lacks grammar in some spots and still sounds sketchy at certain cutscenes. Why we couldn't perfect this, I have no idea. You're a multi-million dollar company, CAPCOM - and we're in the 21st century. I think you probably could have hired better actors or at least done more interesting overdubs. I'm sure you certainly have enough funds to do so.\n","\n","GAMEPLAY - It has its ups and downs. The puzzles are somewhat more simple, but also more difficult at certain points. The character movements are more fluid...but almost TOO fluid. Tapping the B-button and directional button simultaneously to run finds you stepping ahead more than you wanted to, sometimes running past a door or even stepping right into a zombie. You can master the controls, but it takes awhile - which is quite frustrating.\n","\n","The color scheme of the game is very dark, which makes it hard to see things. Plus the added fact that you can't really see if a zombie is around the corner or not (save for the rooms with the mirrors which helps) so you end up running right into the grasp of a feisty friend.\n","\n","DIFFICULTY - If you were hoping that the RE-make of Resident Evil was any easier than the original, keep dreaming. It's actually more difficult; and being that the original was the toughest in the series (up until this), I'm sure many were hoping that the difficulty on the remake was a bit more easy to handle.\n","\n","Some very frustrating things about this game is the limited ammo you get (in the hard mode, you barely have enough to stay alive and have to use the knife half of the time, even if you ARE experienced with the series and know how to save ammo), how fast your health deteriorates, and the all of the god-awful backtracking you must do.\n","\n","Your enemies may also choose to come back to life if you do not eliminate them by burning them.\n","\n","Chris (the stronger of the two in the game) can only take three bites before it's \"lights out\". That includes the ankle munchers. The ammo supply is very short limited, which forces you to use the (very weak and almost useless...ahem) knife throughout the first portion of the game. The characters do have new defense weapons, however, but you must find them (like items) and pick them up. Unfortunately, they too are in short supply.\n","\n","ENVIRONMENT - Okay, we all know that the environments have changed for the remake. So has the mansion. While the brilliantly colorful post-rendered backgrounds may catch your eye, there's several downfalls to the new environment. The rooms that you always remembered never lead to each other. Room A does not lead to Room B. Room A leads to Room D and a half; way down in no-man's land. Which can be both a curse and a blessing; for those who have played the \"original\" every spare minute of their life, this may be a breath of fresh air. But for average players like me, it's rather frustrating. The puzzles have been switched around a fair bit, and there are more enemies.\n","\n","The environment of the game is very dark, and you can't see as well as you'd like. I find myself subconsciously looking for a light switch on the wall every time i enter a new room. With the added danger of zombies and dogs, it's like fighting your way out of a paper bag.\n","\n","I find this game quite frustrating and difficult. I think in the late 90s, the reason Resident Evil 2 seemed more popular and likeable than the first Resident Evil was because they toned down the difficulty without sacrificing the suspense. Just like Resident Evil Zero. Excellent game, totally A+. This game on the other hand, I would rate a C+ or a B-. Graphics are great, environments are great; but those with weak hearts and irritability should probably steer clear of this game.\n","\n","~Jared\n","Stage 1 summary: Why we couldn't perfect this, I have no idea.

You make better weapons appear by lighting fireplaces with THE SAME counselor.  For example, if Debbie lights a fireplace, then Mark goes into the same cabin, it will not be lit.  It will stay lit for Debbie the entire game, however.

One of the most important parts of a console is the controller, because it can actually increase or dampen the enjoyment of playing a game. So how does Microsoft's console's controller stand? Unfortunately, while the overall design is adequate, it's plagued by some serious flaws that might force some gamers to buy peripherals to hook up their Xbox with a Dual Shock 2.\n","First of all, the design of the Xbox controller is remarkably similar to the Dreamcast's controller in size and location of the analog sticks. The D-pad is good enough, and the trigger buttons are also well-made. Gamers might have to strain to reach the black and white buttons above the four face buttons, but that's easy to get used to.\n","The biggest flaw that many gamers, including myself, cite against this controller is its size. Some gamers with large hands might find this controller comfortable, but a lot of gamers can't use the Xbox controller without constant readjustment of the hands. Players sometimes have to strain thier muscles just to reach a particular button or analog stick, which can get really annoying. And while the face buttons are in the right places, they are so bunched together that pressing a wrong button is a frequent problem for some gamers. If Microsoft hadn't used up a lot of room on the controller for the enormous Xbox logo (as if players will need a reminder of what system they're playing), the controller would've been a lot better.\n","Another problem are the buttons themselves. While playing games with this controller, I found that pressing the buttons sometimes didn't register a command in the game, as if the game didn't know I had pressed a button. This might be attributed to the fact that the buttons are pressure-sensitive, but the biggest reason is probably because the buttons are in a horrible oval shape that bulge too far out. If games can't register a decent press given to the buttons, the controller needs some serious adjustment. Coupled with the first problem mentioned, and playing a game can be quite frustrating.\n","Overall, the Xbox controller is fairly decent but it could've been so much more. There is a reason why Microsoft brought the Japanese Xbox controller to the US and is making that the standard Xbox controller: the number of people displeased with the American Xbox controller was too big to ignore. If Microsoft had paid more attention to the sensitivity of the buttons and less attention to the ugly logo that takes up a lot of space on the controller face, the Xbox controller would've been the ultimate controller. As it stands now, it's only for gamers who found the Dual Shock 2 too small to use.\n","Stage 1 summary: So how does Microsoft's console's controller stand?

To the rest of us this game is a new frontier.  One that I encourage you to explore.  The game is an excellant example of what an RPG should be.  It focused on the story, which in my opinion is the most important part aside from the music.  Right from the beginning of the game you are immersed in a deep and involving game that will steal you away from your freinds and family for the 30-35 hours of gameplay, not including the epilouge.  The game is filled with anime style movies that are beautiful to behold and the spoken dialouge, yes spoken, are very well acted.  Working Designs can pat themselves on the back for this one.  The music is simplistic but very moving at times.  The only part I don't like is that there is no beginning animation like in Lunar:SSSC complete with singing.  Then again this story has nothing to do with singing.  The game also is mainly based on a love story, like it's predecesor.  May I say they did a much better job handling this story than FF8.  If you are looking for a game with a love story get this one and leave FF8 alone.  It may look old school with 2-D graphics and a seemingly Super Nintendo look but who plays RPGs for its graphics?  The presence of an epilouge lets you see everything that happened after the game ending.  A nice touch.  It makes it appear that the video game characters actually have lifes and shows you what happened with them. ex. in game there is a town planning a wedding.  In the epilouge you get to watch the wedding.  Well I thought it was cool.  Go ahead and buy the game, or rent it if you want.  Who knows, maybe you'll be paid a visit from Lunar:SSSC characters.\n","Stage 1 summary: Working Designs can pat themselves on the back for this one.   A nice touch.

Up that to 512, plus get a more advanced card like the ATI 9600, or better(the equivelent in nVidia)and together with a 2 ghz machine or better this game will fly!!!\n","\n","Also, for those worried about too many controls, you can customize them to your likeing.

In 2001, Nintendo released Warioland 4 on the Game Boy Advance as one of the first games for that system. And what a game it is: a side scroller, action adventure romp where he looks for treasure once again. You control Wario as he explores a pyramid with different sections and stages. The goal for each stage is to find a key and escape the stage to open up others areas. Along the way, you can collect all kinds of treasure while picking up (or buying) power ups to defeat enemies and/or assist you in getting through the stage. You can find scattered CDs to open up the sound room and listen to various music tracks and you also open up mini games to play as you complete stages.\n","\n","The PROS: The game is very challenging but not to the point of frustration. Every stage is a puzzle in which you have to figure out how to reach the key and then escape before your time is up. Everything from the presentation, graphics and sounds fit the outrageous antics of Wario as he does what he does best: plunder for coins and treasure. With more then 20 stages to explore, this game will keep you busy as you find everything while having fun at the same time. And when you are done with the stages, you can play mini games to get power ups or extra lives.\n","\n","The CONS: This would have been a fun multiplayer title but sadly that didn't make it into this fun. This is solely a 1 player romp but the game can store up to 2 saves so other people can play and save their progress without touching your saved game. Other than that, there aren't any flaws.\n","\n","This is one of the best games to get for the GBA so grab yourself a copy anyway you can. It's challenging but not hard to make you quit, looks and plays great and will keep you busy for awhile (especially if you want to reach the 100% completion status.) I highly recommend this title so it should be in your GBA collection ASAP.\n","Stage 1 summary: Other than that, there aren't any flaws.

It was crashy/buggy on win2k.  I was halfway thru the werewolf town episode and hit a bug that no patch fixed unless I restarted the episode, which I was too[upset]to do.\n","Also, the way to progress is not really that intuitive.  I found myself running around an empty castle a lot trying to figure out wth I'm supposed to do next.  By far the worst aspect of this game was the camera angles.  As you run down a hall, you hit a map trigger that changes your point of view; unfortunately you have no idea what view you will get.  Sometimes you will be looking ahead from behind/above your character, other times you will look at your character's face from ahead/left.  It is weird and extremely unpleasant as you can switch angles during fights accidentally and get your [rear-end]kicked.\n","The good stuff: The graphics are cool, not the most impressive nowadays (2003-05-06) but still neat.  Although they aren't technically superior anymore (they once were) I still like the way the game looks because the designers made the graphics so creepy.  The art on the walls, the dark woods, crypts, you go through all sorts of cool settings.\n","The music is creepy too, and really helps set the mood.  This is actually a scary game to play.\n","The main character is pretty cool.  He's the nameless Clint-Eastwood type with the gravelly voice.\n","All in all this game had awesome potential but was poorly executed.  Much of this could have been avoided by having 1. more predictable and sane camera angles, and 2. a strategy guide.  A lot of times I was stuck for hours and I missed some hidden place or something.  With a quick cheat I would have had a lot more fun without feeling too guilty.\n","I hope they come out with a Nocturne 2 that addresses these issues, I would really like to see it.\n","Stage 1 summary: By far the worst aspect of this game was the camera angles.

The game itself is really fun, but maybe more fun for fans of the TV series. We, as fans, are treated with the return of the entire cast and the writing does feel just like an episode. It being based on the TV series, casual Superman fans may not get the same thrill out of it like those who love the TV show.\n","\n","One of the big things missing from the game is the TV theme song. I was listening for it the entire time, and it never plays. That was kind of a downer. I also wish they had Brainiac and Bizarro on this game, but they are missing as well.\n","\n","What is great about the game is that it is fun and not easy. They didn't make this game extremely easy for the kiddies, but it is actually challenging in some parts. With all of the challenges, the game can still be beat in less than 5 hours.  Overall, this is a game for the fans. If you love the TV series, you will love this. I would suggest that you may want to rent it first if you are just a casual fan of superheroes.\n","Stage 1 summary: The game itself is really fun, but maybe more fun for fans of the TV series.

It's popularity is well-earned. It has an intriguing plot, enjoyable characters and dialogues, and fun boss battles. So why give this game a 3 star rating? I'll tell you why. You collect elementals as you go through the game and the only way to level up their powers from 0 to 8 is to continuously use their powers over and over again. Sometimes you have to use a spell 30 times before it goes up in level. And you're putting yourself at a big disadvantage if you don't level up your elementals as you go through the game. This takes hours away from moving through the stages and storyline and has been a HUGE source of aggravation for me. But maybe I shouldn't be so hard, the bosses are fun to fight. Except at the beginning, when they heal all the damage you dealt to them every 2 minutes! Don't get me wrong: this game is a lot of fun. It just has some rough edges that need to be smoothed out. The game is pretty long and your attacks get pretty powerful and the magic attacks are a lot of fun to watch. I just look back and think about how this could have been one of the best RPG's ever, but because of a few critical mistakes, this game just falls short of greatness. It just ends up being average instead......\n","Stage 1 summary: Secret of Mana is one of the most popular RPG's ever sold for the SNES.

Panzer Dragoon Zwei for Saturn is my favorite video game ever. The music, control, level design, and graphics (not to mention storyline, secrets and multiple endings!) of that game simply put every other 3D shooter to shame (well, Sky Gunner is pretty darn good too).\n","When it was announced that another Panzer Dragoon game was beign made, I was going crazy with anticipation, daring to hope that a game surpassing (or at least equal to) the great Panzer Dragoon Zwei was going to come my way. Now, I own both games and I have to say that Panzer Dragoon Orta (while by no means a bad game) does NOT measure up.\n","Any shooter fan can tell you that in the world of shooters, it really comes down to only a few things. Graphics, control, music, and gameplay. The graphics are the eye-candy that makes you play, great music is what sets the perfect mood, and without great gameplay and control there would be absolutely no point in playing.\n","The first Panzer Dragoon had a gun shot and lock-ons. Panzer Dragoon Zwei had gun shots, lock-ons and berzerkers. Now, we have gun shots, lock-ons, berzerks, dragon morphs, speed-up, and slow-down. Call me crazy, but I DO think that you can have too much of a good thing. I mean, the berzerkers were great and really added to the second game. But when a big boss is killing me the last thing I want to do is slow-down instead of speeding-up while switching to the WRONG FORM OF DRAGON. Sadly, over and over again this is what ended up happening.\n","Shooters are all about reflexes, shooting down all the enemies before they can attack you. This game makes it more about shooting the same enemy in the same way over and over and over. And what of the branching paths? While they add some to the game, there is nothing like the path branch from the second level of Panzer Dragoon Zwei (left take flight, right stay on the ground for the whole level).\n","I have to also say that (sadly) while the visuals of the between-level movies are incredibly animated, they aren't worth watching more than once in most cases (the one in the snow is always cool to me). And why on earth should I watch cinemas when there is no compelling story? Don't even try to tell me that there is the same sort of story-telling in this game that there was in Panzer Dragoon Saga or Zwei (Azel blows Orta away and the intro movie to Zwei where the kid's village is destroyed is better than every cinema in this game combined).\n","In the area of Graphics, Sound, and extras this game really shines. Not only  does this game feature some of the best graphics on the X-Box and feature some great sound effects (the music is okay), it also includes the complete first Panzer Dragoon game.\n","Games like this are becoming more and more rare. If you're hungry for a 3D shooter fix give this game a try. It has awesome graphics, sweet sound, and IS set in the Panzer Dragoon world (and get a load of the Panzer Dragoon Encyclopedia in the extras!).

Here is why...\n","\n","...switching weapon bug. After picking up a weapon I noticed that I can't can't switch it. I hold down the yellow button on the controller and press it and nothing happens. I sometimes reload the checkpoint and it is resolved. For a game this old this problem should have been resolved. I would pick up a sniper rifle because this is probably the best weapon in the game to have if you like to play like I do. Which is kill everything, but from a safe distance. And I wasn't able to use it. Not cool!\n","\n","...Ok so here is probably the most irritating thing in the game and the deal breaker for me. If anybody has ever played Halo 4 they will know what I am talking about. AI using suppressing fire type guns should not be able to casually aim and hit you over and over again from a distance of 400+ yards away. Also there really wasn't any stealthiness to the game other than the premade ways to do it by the developers. Once you come into any sort of area where the enemy is they automatically know where you are and will start shooting at you. Even through walls. As gamers we have moved past the days with having to deal with AI like this. I am not kidding. I would be croutching and walking really slow and BOOM! They would see me and me running to me to get me and alert the insane amount of enemies in the area I was trying to sneak through.\n","\n","...There is an emphasis on being stealth in this game, but they don't give you moves or weapons to be stealthy with other than your stupid melee punch which doesn't work anyway because you can't get close enough to the enemy anyway because they will see you even if you sneak up from behind.\n","\n","So basically I learn really quick that if I wanted to play through this game I would need to put the difficulty on easy and just deal with the gun bug.

Put them all together with a magnificent story full of surprise, humor, death, betrayal, and symbolism and you've got an adventure you'll never forget.\n","\n","I get immersed in this world so easily. The great nations and cities, the airship traffic, the vast landscapes of the over world, they all come together almost seamlessly and create a vibrant place that you will never want to leave. The diversity of the towns and cities are great, and each one brings something different to the story and environment. You have your city of night, your city of perpetual rain, your great militaristic empire, your quaint country village, etc. The environment and the diverse different cultural differences in this fantasy world of Final Fantasy IX I believe is what really keeps me coming back for more and in every sense of the word its a true Fantasy world. Unlike other games such as Final fantasy VIII and VII which have a more cyberpunk metropolitan and or more realistic vision of a fantasy world. But I guess thats all personal preference, what you want to see portrayed and represented in the game.\n","\n","The characters of Final fantasy IX have more of a charming chibi like appearance as opposed to early final fantasy games. But overall I think this looks a lot better than dull character designs of final fantasy VIII.\n","\n","The characters can be somewhat stereotypical: you of course have your standard frail female white mage and your beefy dimwitted guard, but their interactions still are entertaining and involving to the highest degree. The characters imo as a whole probably do not live up to the complexity and sophisticated plot scenarios as seen in Final fantasy VI or VII but you will be engrossed in the story itself probably not to notice these minor clich moments. One of which is the romantic relationship between Garnet and Zidane, which imo is not a huge focus as it could have been, such as Final fantasy VII (aires and Cloud) or final fantasy VIIIs (Squall and Rinoa) The game itself has a lot of plot twist and unexpected turns that will keep you always wondering what is going to happen next in the story, although the ending is a typical ending that is not very original. But the many plot elements in the game leading up to that point are very interesting and much thought provoking that you will enjoy it.\n","\n","I absolutely cant mention FF IX without talking about the extra features or mini games in the game. There is so much extra content in this game that it pretty much rivals or is close to Final fantasy XII in terms of content. There are just tons of little extra things you can do in the game, some of which I poured hrs upon hrs into, one of the really fun and popular minigames is the Card game called Tetra Master You might find yourself actually playing that more than the actual game xD. In fact partway through the story its actually required that you complete a tournament. Like final fantasy VIII whitch had a card game minigame that was challenging and interesting, I found IXs to be my most favorite personally. Literally it would take me an entire whole page to mention all of the extra features this game has. It has its own chocobo popular mini game where you have to go locate certain treasure around the world as Choco graphs, some of them can be a pain to find, but I found it rewarding and interesting, you get lots of items and even access to an optional super boss Ozma. There is a jump rope mini game, Frog Capturing with Quina, The hot and cold Chocobo mini game, you can even play black jack at the ending after the credits roll as a little Easter egg, you have to input some crazy button combination but its fun.\n","\n","They even included a playonline strategy guide to promote the game, im probably one of the few people that actually is still in possession of this guide. I treasure it to this day there is no guide quite like it and it just no longer exists on the internet any more. It is around 400 pages in length but if you're a completionist, it covers everything, including some things that were very rare and deep buried secrets not seen anywhere else.\n","\n","FFIX is in fact quite beautiful. This game represents the pinnacle of visuals on the playstation. The truly amazing thing about these visuals is that I feel they have more lasting power than most other FF games, whether they are of the age of sprites or the newer polygon models. The amazing CG sequences marveled me and left my mouth on the floor. The standard gameplay graphics are even something great to look at as is the all the extra content in the game. This is in every bit worth a purchase. The only thing i could probably mention that might put some people off is the different chibi like model characters, but if you can look past that and it doesn't bother you, then this game will have you suckered into its expansive environments and beautifully written fantasy story one of the most diversified character cast you'll ever come across in a final fantasy game.\n","\n","Go out and Buy it! :D\n","Stage 1 summary: I get immersed in this world so easily.

Very original. Truthfully, it doesn't sound neither appealing or interesting. Although the gameplay is incredible. Whenever I would walk into a store and play a demo of it, I would always think that it was somewhat, boring. But when I got the game, I realized that as soon as you get past the first day or two, it is extremely addictive. The whole objective is to get all 30 peices within 30 days. And its very fun getting larger quantities of pikmin so you can do more things at one time. And all the kinds of pikmin have their own unique strengths (example: yellow-throwing molten rocks & jumping higher. blue-is able to swim in water. red-is able to with-stand any fire and/or fire attacks by enemies). This is definetly a challenging game, and it isn't one that you can beat over night. It truly is a great strategic game that keeps you thinking..... I hope this review was helpful to you if you are looking for a video game.\n","Thankyou,\n","*Vapor*\n","Stage 1 summary: Although the gameplay is incredible. blue-is able to swim in water.

By that point SH 3 had become difficult to find. It seems like all these games have that defining fault. (Luckily I'm getting an X-box 360 about the time SH V hits shelves). Regardless I'm sure you've heard many things both  good and bad about this one when in comparison to SH 2.\n","\n","Well the truth is I'm not a SH 2 fanatic. I actually liked James alot, and yes his story was interesting but what some people termed \"gradual build up of suspense\" I thought was boring as I explored a town that was in many ways a bit too open ended. Yes, SH 2 is longer than SH 3 (I own it too) but does longer always equate to better? I suppose that depends on who you are.\n","\n","The truth is I'm a lover of the first game. Alot of fans say it was too\n","\"cult influenced\" but when you think about it the monsters were STILL generated by someone's nightmarish delusions and it was still far more psychological than it was cheap shock thrills. (Not that there is anything wrong with the later either mind you. Yes, I do like RE as well.)\n","\n","SH 3 is a little piece of black sunshine in many ways. First of all it is the first time a girl protagonist is introduced. I've heard many debates about Heather. You either love her or hate her. But before you past that judgement you should get to know her. Yes Heather is a wise cracking loner. She does not hang out with gaggles of giggling girls her age. She doesn't like being followed and yes, she has major \"trust issues\". If she was like this for no reason I could understand the angst of gamers. But as it stands she has a VERY GOOD REASON for being as paranoid and aloft as she is. The only man she can trust is her dad and when you find out who she was in the past you can forgive her for being abrasive. SH 3 does much to prove \"human beings\" are the worst monsters and not even Pyramid head can compete with the scum baggery of certain individuals out there.\n","\n","The game is definetly a roller coaster ride. Your dream sequence in the amusement park is scary enough to make you question playing further. Right from the beginning you are dropped into the jaws of hell and they bite down hard.\n","\n","SH 3 does mess with you. For example there are parts in the game you \"almost\" feel safe. No monsters around and you can hear comforting muffled human voices on the other side of the walls. You actually start your true journey having over slept in a mall that has closed down around you. Their is a very subtle anxiety about trying to make your way out of a building past closing time. Its' not you fear monsters or irrate security guards. It just feels creepy being in a place that normally bustles with activity after everyone has gone home.\n","\n","In the first area Douglas a concerned detective and a strange woman named Claudia make their appearances. Douglas is hired by Claudia to take you back to your \"home town\" under the suspicion you have  been kidnapped. Actually it gets sloppier. Your father killed someone in self defense and you have both been on the run awhile making your situation questionable. Apparently your \"happy home-life\" has not always been so happy.\n","\n","Of course being Heather you don't trust Douglas the middle aged gruff cop movie reject nor do you trust Claudia even though she claims you used to be friends that grew up together. Like a typical teen with angst issues you set out on your own.\n","\n","From here on out there are things worth noting. The first is the graphics in this game are darkly beautiful and filled with ambient atmosphere. Truth be told this is the best looking SH out there. Secondly the creatures are bigger and meaner. Some fans liked this...others did not. Regardless the strait jacketed spinning pendulums with their whirling blades and the fat grotesque insane cancers add a sense of claustophobia and impending doom when you are sandwiched in close quarters.\n","\n","The enviorments are also worth complimenting. The subway, church, and lake side amusement park haunted house come to mind immediatly and throughout the game alot it divulged about your past as well as that of \"The Order\" everyone's favorite group of resident crazies.\n","\n","Claudia and Douglas are interesting enough but when you meet Vincent your really in for a mind freak. Vincent is almost too genial and polite making you think a cackling insanity is being held down just beneath the surface. He even makes you question if the \"monsters\" you have been slaying are actually real people and it is obscure to figure out which side he is on.\n","\n","As the game progresses these people fall into the roles of \"watchers\" \"antagonists\" and \"supporting friends\" but I will not give away anymore than that. Regardless the point is the side characters are well defined and intriguing which has always been a trade-mark of the SH mythos.\n","\n","By the end of the game I was endeared to Heather alot. She was not perfect but frankly I get tired of perfect anyway. She was not \"super model beautiful\" but yet she was cute enough to be that girl next door you might have had a crush on. Heather is \"one of us\" the normal people and in that lies her charm. She is acessible and you could imagine hanging out with her doing stuff you'd do with your friends. Though she gets scared she is brave and dedicated. While her laugh sounds more like a whimper when confronting various monsters at least she trudges onward and once you DO earn her trust she's there for you through thick and thin. Females really don't have many good role-models in gaming so in that regard Heather is a breath of fresh air. She dresses plain and her cleavage is not about to bust out of her shirt.\n","\n","I should mention the game-play is a bit smoother compared to SH 2 but not much. The combat system in SH has never been deep but if you could multi-hit combo creatures through walls it would defeat the aspect of being a normal smuck amongst terrifying circumstances. As before you get an assortment of melee weapons and a few guns. As before you can stomp creatures on the ground though some of them will try to latch onto you. Beat the game and you'll get a few nifty items that pack alot of punch or are blatantly ridiculous fan service.\n","\n","The only negative gripe I have with SH 3 is not so much it is a bit linear (I don't mind that) but that it only has 2 endings. Ok 3 if you count the usual UFO parody ending but compared to SH 2 its' like they made a sub-way sandwich with less meat. It still tastes great but it is definetly not as filling. For some this will hurt the re-play value.\n","\n","Regadless if you can pick up this game. I don't exactly know how easy it is to find but it is likely one of the better installments in the series.\n","Stage 1 summary: You either love her or hate her.

The software team at Blizzard has outdone themselves once again, bringing us yet another great Role-play stategy masterpiece.  Frozen Throne gives us more Warcraft 3, chock full of great new units, diverse new heroes, and 26 new levels in the campaign/story of Azeroth.  Frozen Throne is full of new items, creeps, and multiplayer options and levels.  I really can't think of anything worth complaining about concerning this release.  I myself found Warcraft 3 to be a little difficult; even after playing for months and honing my skills.  Fortuneatly, if you have a hard time with Frozen Throne and get tired of punching the monitor in aggravation, you can now adjust the difficulty of your opponent.  Three settings: Easy, Normal, and Insane.  There is also a nifty Handicap option in the setup screen that can make computer controlled players a bit weaker.  So aside from the cool new units and heroes, this game brings more balance to the Warcraft experience.  Blizzard has done a great job adjusting and modifying units, hit points, and build times from the previous game.  For instance:  Some buildings now build faster, certain units cost less food points, and the total food cap is now raised. - Adversely, some buildings now take longer to upgrade, heroes gain experience slower after a time, and particular items are now more expensive etc..  The list goes on.  Though I am glad to report that just about all of the changes are good.  The game is better balanced and a bit more fun now.  The new units and maps (even has weather effects now -/snow/ rain) breathe new life into the Warcraft world.  This is definitely a better offering than the original Warcraft 3.  -Hardcore RTS/RPS gamers and newcomers alike would be foolish to pass up a seat on The Frozen Throne.\n","Stage 1 summary: This is practically a whole new game.

I do like to try out games in other genre, and Devil May Cry has certainly been the recipient of much critical (and enthusiast acclaim).  With the price being as attractive as it is I decided that this would be my semi-annual dip into the world of compulsive destruction.\n","The story is straightforward.  Girl drives into occult detective's office, stabs him with his own sword, then asks for his help in fighting the underworld.  It seems that a BIG evil is planning to take over the earth and has set up shop in a castle on Malay Island.  Dante, by the way, is the son of the demon knight who originally defeated this particular BIG evil.  So revenge is also on the menu.\n","What ensues is a mad dash through a gothic nightmare that augments normal castle architecture with jungles, ships, airplanes, outer space, and, of course, hell. [I guess the story wasn't so straightforward after all]  All of this is an excuse for some of the most detailed graphics that I have ever seen.\n","The animation is of such high quality that you can't always tell where a cut scene ends and the action starts again.  And, lest I forget, an array of weapons, gadgets, and puzzles that kept me busy from start to finish.  Very little was spared in making this a spectacular playing experience.\n","My only complaints aren't about the game, but my own mediocre skills.  While I'm not exactly arthritic, my ability to deftly poke and stroke my controller is substandard.  And Devil May Cry is a game that requires both pinpoint accuracy and good timing.  Which means that the twelve hours of play that ended with me stumbling into the finale did nothing for my self-esteem.  But if you have two thumbs (instead of ten) you will find this a delightful pastime - a must play, should own game.\n","Stage 1 summary: The story is straightforward.

This game is one of the coolest action games you will ever play. To start with the lead character Dante is the coolest protagonist on digital media. He is like Claire Redfield, Lara Croft, and Simon Belmont all rolled into one. His movement are the best ever in an action game. He can leap, roll, run, walk, and bounce off the wallls like a crazy banchee.\n","Dante's weapons are cool too. He has dual automatic pistols as well as a huge freaking sword. He can use any of them with lighting fast speed and surgical precision. The combos you can link with these two weapons are pretty much limitless.\n","The graphics are simply stunning. The game uses a fixed camera view, so it  a lot like Resident Evil. The castles are gothic style architecture, and the game is like what a Next-generation Castlevania should be.\n","My only complaint is that the world is so beautiful and you are stuck exploring it through a mission-stlye interface instead of a free flowing free exploration interface. I wished the game was set up with a \"central hub\" like Soul Reaver.\n","All in all, however, the game is quite stunning. It is a lot like Oniumusha, but your character is a lot cooler. It is the first time in a fixed camera game, that I know of, that the character can move and attack at the same time. This is very sweet! Resident Evil should incorporate this action into their series. You also have a lot more manueverability than in Onimusha or Resident Evil.

Should you feel it necessary to buy absolutely every individual cartridge/disc of the six games contained on the two SF Collections, then do so and spend a ton of cash. They are all excellent titles, but the two collections of a game that defined the fighting genre are perfect. Street Fighter Collection, the original that is in the spotlight, is actually the more up-to-date one. While it does not contain the original Street Fighter II, it does contain 3 classic Street Fighter games. First is Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers, released on SNES and Genesis in 1994. It was mindbendingly good the first time I played it. It had a solid 16 fighters. All 8 from Street Fighter II, the bosses, plus 4 new characters never heard of before: Cammy, Dee Jay, Fei Long, and T. Hawk. You might think, \"Oh wow, a new edition with new fighters. Never seen THAT before.\" Well, you're wrong. Super Street Fighter II did contain 4 new arenas (respectively the ones for the new fighters). It also had newly mixed music, newly animated profile shots, and newly animated backgrounds. Basically, it was a perfect upgrade. Super Street Fighter II Turbo is also included. It may seem like Super Street Fighter II with the speed like Street Fighter II Turbo, but it added something. Each character had one SUPER MOVE. From Ryu and Ken's Shinkuu Hadoken to Chun Li's Kikousho, they really gave a great new edge to the series. Akuma is even hidden in this upgrade. Also, the definitive of the three Street Fighter Alpha games, Street Fighter Alpha 2, gets upgraded to Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold Edition. Cammy is added on, and Evil Ryu becomes playable (YAY!). What's strange is that some of the cast gets an additional playability in their SFII:CE animation. So it's definetely worth picking this up...if you don't already have all three of these games for your SNES (Alpha 2 is also on the PS).\n","Stage 1 summary: Street Fighter is perhaps the definitive fighting game series.

Not only does it address the latent issues and problems with the first Zero game, but it goes one step further to make for a very strong platforming title skilled gamers should consider.\n","Zero 2 returns us to the distant future where Reploids (sentient robots) are the subject of genocide attempts by Neo Arcadia, a faction created by humans to eliminate the Reploids, whose free will they believe is a threat to their livelihood.  A new commander for the Reploid resistance movement, Elpizo, goes on the warpath to bring Neo Arcadia down once and for all.  The story presented in Zero 2 is a notably complicated one that links elements from the Mega Man X series and the previous Zero game.\n","Aside from the sinister new bosses and stages, there are a lot of things to find and collect.  Zero 2 brings back the Cyber Elf system, where you can raise elves so you may take on special powers.  Zero also has a Shield Boomerang (deflects shots back at enemies) and the Chain Rod (a grappling hook).  There are also special Forms that change Zero's appearance and add special attributes tailored to your playing style.  Finally, there are EX Skills, special attacks and moves, that are rewarded to the most hardcore of games.  Clearly, there is a lot of incentive to replay the game.\n","Graphically, this game continues the high standard set forth in its predecessor for fluid and vibrant animation and design.  Again, expect subtle use of \"Mode 7\" effects and transparency details to create rather compelling environments.  Sound is one of the most improved aspects, with the music being more catchy and memorable than in the previous game.  There is also a liberal use of voice effects (the final boss is particularly well done in this regard).  The controls, as we would expect, are nearly flawless.  However, I would echo the sentiment that the Chain Rod demands a little too much precision.\n","I had two complaints about the first Zero game, both of which are rectified in Zero 2.  The primary complaint was that feeding Cyber Elves energy was a tedious process that bogged the game down.  In this game, there are more locations with copious elf energy capsules such that this doesn't become a problem.  The second was the overall difficulty and limited continues.  Zero 2 goes back to the traditional Mega Man arrangement of limited lives, but unlimited continues, which greatly eases the game.  Additionally, there are up to four Sub-Tanks (energy refillers), a 2x life meter upgrade in the game, and an upgrade that makes spikes and lava non-lethal.  In other words, the Cyber Elf system works as it should - it can make the game much, much easier for the casual gamer while maintaining an extreme difficulty level for the diehard fan.  For using elves, you are penalized by not getting a high rank for each stage, but this does not affect the ending - only the ability to get special EX Skills.\n","Drawbacks?  I think that for casual gamers, the game is still a bit ruthless early on.  Trying to beat your first boss can be challenging.  There should be a pushover of a boss, along with a very easy stage, among the initial four.  Second, compared to the Japanese-to-English translation of the first game, Capcom kinda' botched this one.  Although the plot makes sense, there are a lot of unprofessional grammatical errors and mistakes that should have been caught by translators.  But, clearly, these are minor problems to an otherwise great game.\n","If you think all of the Mega Man games are the same, or thought that Mega Man X7 was a disaster, Mega Man Zero 2 should restore your faith in the series.  Even for newcomers, this is a great platform game - one of the best on the Game Boy Advance.  Highly recommended.\n","Stage 1 summary: I had two complaints about the first Zero game, both of which are rectified in Zero 2.   But, clearly, these are minor problems to an otherwise great game.

However, the game is not a bad RPG.  If you simply just want to pass the time and play an RPG, then this game will do.  Just do not expect it to be anywhere near as good as FFX.

Sandbox is great fun but this review will mostly deal with the meat of the game - the long, excellent campaign.\n","It's made up of about 16 or 17 scenarios, some easy, some harder than the others. You deal with the same area, but you slowly add more and more restaurants. One of the funnest aspects of this game is the RPG aspect. You play a chef, Armand, and talk to people through him (in special sequences). The chefs gain experience through cooking - if they cook only amerian soups they will become excellent with that but know nothing about french and italian! That's right - this game has 3 main types of food and restaurants, with a few subcategories (seafood, steak) thrown in.\n","You lay out the entire restaurant much in the fashion of THE SIMS, with some nifty things to choose from (I wonder if someone could make some objects to use in the game hmm). You hire staff, choose recipes to include on your menu, serves customers their favorite food in order to gain customer satisfatcion, lay out your menu, assign selected chefs to selected recipes so they can grow super good at that particular thing. Shop and buy ingredients with Armand, or through the main way, the supplier list. Improve your food, buy recipes off of customers, sell secrets if you're low on money (these last two are only when the oppurtunities are given).\n","The tutorial is very easy to follow, but there were some things it took me awhile to discover myself. But that's part of the games charm - its very in depth, but not overwhelmingly so. It focuses more on cooking and making your customers happy - which in turn leads to more money.\n","Another great aspect are the cooking contests. Armand (or sometimes other chefs) can enter - but make sure their skills are up to par. Different contests require different things.\n","Here is the low down: (1= horrendously terrible 10 = fabulously stupfying)\n","GRAPHICS: 7 -  nothing fancy, but cute enough\n","SOUND: 6 - decent restaurant music - plus you can use winamp while you play.\n","GAMEPLAY: 9 - easy to learn, lots of features designed to make going through all the restaurants easier\n","PLAY VALUE: 9 The one campaign should take a good 40 hours to go through the first time, and sandbox gives endless oppurtunities.\n","FUN: 10!\n","OVERALL: 8.2\n","About 4 stars on Amazon I guess :)\n","If you like the sims, the IDEA behind those crap old tycoons, business sims, rollercoaster tycoon etc you should give this a roll.

The food limit was 100, and I had thought this would be reasonable anyway, it wasn't, as I spent about 10 or so workers trying to build up resources, as normally, gold is gathered at +10 per few seconds, and +5 wood per.  Come on! Then most major processes seemed to be a one-at-a-time deal making it take forever to build new buildings, learn new skills, and even just making troops leaving me open to attack.  What really bugged me though was two things: first, you can't gather without your base creating a catch 22 where if it is destroyed you need a base to gain materials to build a new base.  The second is the way food is gathered and done.  It's counterintuitive.  Rather than hunting down critters and expending resources, making food decrease when you breed critters(thereby allowing more troops) you have to operate within a very artificial limit.  And it doesn't seem any way you can dismiss your characters, nor does there seem to be a way to convert (*cough* useless *cough*) workers into fighters, so you have 10 workers hanging about which should be 3-5 fighters. It is an overhyped, overrated game as most of the major problems are addressed in Age of Empires/Myth games (the food, the workers could at least fight, and if your base is destroyed, you just die rather than be humiliated by not having the resources) or the Heroes of Might and Magic games (your hero that uses magic is actually leader of troops rather than someone who just gets killed off along with the rest, and they have wider selection of spells to boot).\n","Stage 1 summary: I played this game at an online convention.

Rich color and textures along with new gameplay elements make this a must have for the GBA!  The third RPG in the Mario franchise we've seen.  Mario and Luigi combines the elements of Paper Mario and Super Mario RPG to create yet another RPG masterpiece.\n","To start off are the graphics.  The graphics presented to us are very well done.  Rich colorful environments decorate this game in a way we've never thought possible on the GBA.  Mario, Luigi and other characters are visually stunning.  The animations in battle are simple, yet fun to look at.  You'll no doubt be impressed by the graphics the first time around.\n","The music and other sound in this game is also quite good.  Music from nearly all the Mario games is mixed into the bunch as well as introducing new tunes.  The new tunes are quite remarkable, especially for the GBA.  While some tunes get a little repetitive and loop around much too quickly, you'll quickly get used to it, as it is a minor flaw.\n","The story is that a witch named Cackletta from the neighboring Kingdom of Beanbean has stolen Princess Toadstool's beautiful voice and has replaced it with explosives. Each time Toadstool speaks you'll see a lot of symbols pop up in her dialogue box and then come down to the ground with an explosion.  When Bowser comes to kidnap the Princess he soon realizes that she would probably ruin his castle.  In short, Bowser decides to help Mario and Luigi.\n","What was even more remarkable are the voices in the game.  Mario and Luigi don't scream, grunt, groan and moan for every action they do, but they're voices are still pretty well done.  Bowser's voice is also impressive.  Voices are very well done on this game so you shouldn't find yourself turning down the volume a whole lot.  Mario and Luigi never really say anything; instead you hear them speaking gibberish a lot of the time when they communicate.\n","The game also presents a lot of moments that'll without a doubt make you laugh.  Even the opening cinema and beginning of the game are pretty funny.  So you'll find a lot of entertainment with this that I think you'll really love.\n","The battle system is quite different from your standard Turn-Based RPG as well as on the field.  For example, the A-Button controls one character and the B-Button controls another.  The start button switches Mario and Luigi around so that the other one leads (so if Mario is leading push start and Luigi steps in front).  So they're both on the over world map.  If Mario is leading the A-Button Controls him, and the B-button controls Luigi and vice-versa.\n","What's even more important is that in battle the A-Button ALWAYS controls Mario and the B-Button ALWAYS controls Luigi.  This is always true in battle.  There are four commands in battle: Solo Attack, Bros. Attack, Items and Run.  The Solo Attack allows your character to attack of course.  But remember that if it's Luigi you use the B-Button.  Much like Super Mario RPG you've got \"Timed-Hits\".  Pressing a button right before the attack connects causes a more powerful hit.  Bros. Attacks are different. This is where Mario and Luigi do a duel attack to an enemy.  You must execute by entering the right button commands as they appear on screen. If you decide you want to make them harder to pull off you can do them without the aid of button commands and have the speed at which the attack is executed at increased.  Of course the harder one you choose the more damage it'll do.\n","What's also interesting is that you can dodge attacks.  When an enemy comes to attack you, press the button that corresponds to that character to dodge the attack.  So if an enemy attacks Mario you'd press A.\n","Mario and Luigi can also use techniques on the field.  Luigi can jump on Mario's head and perform a high-jump and Mario can jump on Luigi's for a spin jump.  They can also use hammers which they can smash blocks with too.\n","I've only about one or two cons with the game.  One is you only have Mario and Luigi. No one else joins the party.  This isn't really a con but for an RPG there are some RPGers who expect more characters to control. The other con however, is that they included the arcade Mario Bros.  While this isn't necessarily bad, it's on EVERY Mario game on the GBA!  It was nice at first but after the second Mario Advance game it just began to lose my interest.  I'm sure many will probably overlook the Original Mario Bros. Game.\n","However, Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga is excellent for the GBA. It's the first original Mario game on the GBA and for that I'm glad.  This is without a doubt one of the greatest GBA games we've ever seen before.\n","Stage 1 summary: Even the opening cinema and beginning of the game are pretty funny.

If you've played, you know what that means, so I won't waste your time. If you haven't played it, you probably wouldn't buy this one, so why waste your time? Moving on...\n","Grinching (complaints)\n","What happened to the side-step function? It's a real pain to manuever Lara to where she's supposed to stand, sometimes. Just moving a smidgen to the left or right, or turning a few degrees to be able to grab \"X\" could have been easily bypassed with the old Side-Step. And I didn't see a good reason for taking it out, so why is it gone? Use the R3 or L3 buttons, after all.\n","Not really pleased with the lack of an auto-centering camera. The default placement for the camera sitting behind and above Lara's head is useful when you're running in circles, and yet it too seems to have taken this time to go on vacation. That's frustrating.\n","WHAT is up with switching the controls around? Again, there doesn't seem to be a reason for it except to make veteran players spaz out from time to time. At first, that's infuriating, then annoying, then funny, then back to annoying. And it was unnecessary. His majesty does not approve.\n","Huzzahs (kudos)\n","The graphics are great. Things don't turn all blocky when you stand next to them. There are some lighting issues on items you're picking up, but that's not a big deal. And sure, there's some slow-down here and there, but as one reviewer noted, it's Matrix-y. I can live with it, especially since it hasn't done that during a battle that I've seen.\n","The plot is interesting enough. I like that interaction with the people around you, and the Wing Commander-style options in conversations. That adds a definite element of involvement to the game, and makes a questioning person like me wonder what would happen if I said something different. Enhances replay value, I believe.\n","Save anywhere. FINALLY! Instead of having to find the Magic Memory Crystal to save your progress, you can just punch a button and move on. That reduces a LOT of the aggravation and repetitiveness of the earlier games. Good move, folks. As well, you can save at up to 8 points in the standard memory slot assigned to the game (on one memory card. It's kinda confusing when I read it, but, well... sorry). Nice touch, and lets you explore alternatives to what you've done without having to play the whole game over again.\n","More health lying around. More money, too, which is a little weird. If Paris citizens are leaving that much money and ancient dubloons lying on the ground, I'm definitely going to visit. But the extra health is good, since there's a lot of getting hurt in this game. Then again, maybe I'm just not very good at it...\n","All in all, a solid addition to the Tomb Raider series. It's definitely playable, and fun, but there are enough differences that old timers might not enjoy it. More interactive things heighten the experience a little I think, but there's likely not enough to draw new players. Recommend renting it before you buy it, just to be sure.\n","Stage 1 summary: Use the R3 or L3 buttons, after all. Not really pleased with the lack of an auto-centering camera.

I thought the video game would be much of the same. Fun, great story, good graphics and overall just something to spend time playing. Well, I was wrong. This game is nothing like the movie, and in my opinion was a very over-hyped game. \"Why?\"\n","1. The gameplay: It's just boring. You start off spending an hour in the Shire, trying to do various tasks, which are rewarded very lightly. For example, you have to give the lady who's buying your house a letter, which takes 15 minutes to find (usually more). There is no map of the Shire, no hints of what to do. Everything has to be figured out by yourself. So after you find the little paper or letter, you walk back to give it to her. But nooooooooo wait, you have to find another item without any help and ring a bell because she believe there are \"Wolves\" in the shire. That's another 15 minutes if your lucky, 30-45 minutes if your not. You also have to complete close to a dozen tasks to get your \"Corruption\" rating up. If you become to corrupted (it's a second bar above your health), you just die. I had to start over several times because of that. So say that somehow you do get all this done, get stocked with supplies, talk to everyone, and are ready to go in less than 2 hours, you must escape the black riders. I did this, and it is extremely difficult, and yet in parts so easy it's stupid. There is always a certain area you can go where the black riders can't get u. And yet at the end, u must make a run for it. No where to go, no where to hide. And the black rider you must at the end escape from, is on a horse. Well, if you get past all that in 3 hours, without dieing, your lucky. Most people don't. And the whole process is just boring. No excitement, no real rewards. I hated the first part.\n","Well, once your out of the Shire, you head into a forest. The forest is full of creatures, which are all so easy to kill. You must find your 3 companions who came with u, who somehow get lost in 4 different parts of the forest. This alone took another hour, and if your not lucky, you'll get lost forever (literally). Once past that, you are caught by a willow tree, when u are suddenly saved by a fat, short man named \"Tom Bambaldi\" or something like that. You must then find 15 lilies, which takes another 30 minutes. At this point, I had died 5 times, had not found anything I liked, was bored, and was just sick of the repetitiveness of the game. That was my wonderful experience playing this game (luckily I rented, and returned the next day).\n","Graphics: This would get probably 4 stars. The graphics are pretty goood, but are PS2 graphics. It wasn't what it could have been. For example: The black riders are in total 3D, and look really cool. But their capes for some reason are flat and are in 2D. Very dumb. You can't go in the water, which once again, looks very bad. The leaves you can quote \"Run through\" you can only run through once. And they are very rare, only a few for each part of the level. But in many aspects, the game was good. You can break many things, and that's always fun as they fully destruct. The Shire is brought to life well, and in many ways, this game was fun to look at. But with the horrible gameplay, this game could not be saved.\n","3. Sound / Lasting Appeal: Well, the voice acting was fantastic, and the one point where this game was 5 stars. It was always fun to listen to people talk, and the cut scenes are very well done. Unfortunantly, this was the only fun part of the game. As for the lasting appeal, none. It takes 5 hours just to get a chapter into the story, and the whole thing, I'm afraid, just bored me.\n","If you think you can stand all this, then this is the game for u. Persounally, I think a game should start out easy and become challenging later on, and let u do something cool and interesting within the first hour. Some may like this game, but I sure didn't. Over-hyped, and over-bought, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring for the XBOX, PS2, and PC was a disapointment in my mind.\n","Hope this helped, and I prevented those who would have hated this game from making a VERY tragic decision.\n","Thx!\n","Stage 1 summary: The gameplay: It's just boring.

In addition to all the other frustrations voiced, the online play is horrendous. It is the slowest first person shooter online of any game I've played. And I've played a ton of them. I had a straight ethernet hookup to my campus's network. My average bandwidth was about 2.7 Meg/sec. That's about 20 times the average bandwidth of DSL (I'm talking average, not peak). I have a 2.4 Gig processor with 512 meg ram and a radeon 9600 video card. I was STILL having lag. It was almost comical it was so bad sometimes. If I was hosting, I would find that the poor people who had DSL or, heaven forbid, dial-up would be shooting in a totally different direction than where I was because the network didn't update our positions quickly enough. Anyone who has this game knows what I'm talking about.\n","The real travesty of this game is that the multiplayer maps are INCREDIBLE. They are 10 times better than Halo for Xbox, which is why this game is so frustrating: you have no chance to fully enjoy playing your friends because the whole multiplayer experience is just one big lagfest. To get a better idea of how unpopular this has become, go to bungie.net and click on their link to Halo for PC. Take a quick gander at how many people are playing at any given time. I just checked and it was 2455. This is worldwide, mind you. Doesn't that seem rather low? Even now, over 10 times that many people are playing Starcraft, a dinosaur compared to Halo.\n","I have sold my copy of Halo PC to some poor schmoe. (Sorry, poor schmoe).

The battle screen in FFX loads quickly, battles are bug-free (remember the 'mblock stat' and 'dark status' bugs in FFVI), and the turn system in FFX takes into consideration character speed and execution time for moves, in order to determine when to give each character another turn, rather than working in battle rounds, like in FF 1-3. The result is a battle system tactically similar to the ATB system, except which allows for easy character and equipment swapping, and features no delay between the selection and execution of a move, keeping the battles moving along at maximum speed. The quality of battle action animations are at a series high in this game, and overkill bonuses, plus the ability to fight using Aeons, give the player extra battle mechanics to consider, just when hacking and slashing start to get a little dull. Although originating in Lunar, the in-battle voices in this game add a lot to it, with what characters say in battle often determined by the opponent, or combination of characters in the party, rather than merely the move being executed.\n","\n","The voice acting in FFX is generally high-quality, although the abundance of voice acting serves to disguise the fact that the characters have much less to talk about in FFX than in FFVII through FFIX. Like FFVII, FFX often features five-minute cutscenes filled with dialogue, although the actual amount of dialogue present in five minutes' worth of voice acting is significantly less than in five minutes' worth of text boxes, with the final result being that FFX features a shallower story with less character development. The game's story has an annoying pattern of explicitly emphasizing moral dilemmas which should already be obvious to the player (ex: dialogue such as: \"Is it really okay to hate the Al-Bhed?\"), overemphasizing the emotion of particular scenes (\"Nobody could believe that Yuna was about to call the final Aeon, and that meant...\"), and allowing its characters to act too much like themselves (Wakka's continued objections to disobedience towards Yevon's teachings, even after exposing Yevon's corruption). After the reasonably mature stories of FF7-9, this game's story comes of as positively childish, despite featuring a good amount of philisophical content regarding the nature of death, because the dialogue is written with a constant degree of paranioa that the player won't understand the significance of certain scenes, and most of the time, the characters exist not to interact, but rather to be different from one another.\n","\n","One particularly annoying flaw in FFX is the field exploration screen, where the edges of navigable areas do not in any way correspond with the position of walls and barriers, so the majority of the time, field avatar Tidus is exploring a dungeon or forest until he runs into a barricade of... absolutely nothing! This causes the player to spend more time looking at the minimap for the position of the abstract walls than the field screen for the position of the illustrated ones, and actually discourages the player from enjoying the level of detail that the illustrators have put into the game's environments. The music in FFX, while not bad, is also unspectacular.\n","Stage 1 summary: Although which FF game has the mechanically-best battle system is heavily debatable, FFX has the best-implemented battle system of the entire series, except possibly for FF Tactics.

The wonderful part is they all have their own unique fighting styles which keeps the action from getting dull.\n","With mulitple game modes this also adds to Tekkens variety and level of fun.

It is just plain fun FUN FUN! I would recommend this game to any people that liked the games mentioned above. This is why i gave it 5 stars:\n","Single-player: awesome. you start off with one city, and then you keep adding (the maximum is 8 i think). You can invade enemy territoty and try to conquer them. And believe me, you can't just march in there with a huge amount of soldiers and expect to decimate them. Oh no. They have the homefield advantage. Their reinforcements keep coming & coming & coming. One time, I was fighting for a city on my border and the French's border. I fought for that city for almost half of the game. I would get it, then they would. This went on & on, just like real life. This game is very realistic and extremely fun. They also have a conquer the world campigne, but i don't find it amussing.\n","Another good quality is that the people move very fast, which is a major advancement.

I found VII great but kind of sluggishly-paced; ditto with IX which had attractive visuals, lovely music but a slow narrative at times. With VIII, the graphics got kicked up a notch, the FMV's became more cinematic and the storyline was more adult and sophisticated. However, some love it and many hated it and there's still people who outright despite this game. Sure it's got a few nagging problems but in my opinion, this was my favorite in the series to experience.\n","\n","Story: You play as Squall, a student at the Balamb Garden which specializes in turning students into SEED's, elite mercenaries that get dispatched to different parts of the world to resolve conflicts. One mission has him getting involved with the Timber Owls, a resistance group headed by Rinoa. Squall and Rinoa, along with 4 others, will eventually get caught up in a story involving space travel, a powerful sorceress and a trip through time.\n","\n","Graphics: Often-criticized for having \"Popeye\" arms, the characters now look completely realistic and proportioned evenly. The world itself however looks kind of drab as there isn't a lot of locations that make you go \"holy ****!\", Esthar being the exception. But where the game shines is the FMV's which have an even more movie-like quality in its direction and look than VII's. While the change from pre-rendered to the FMV's is obvious now, it helps make the transitions more seamless.\n","\n","Sound/Music: No voice acting (till X) but again we have another great soundtrack by Nobuo Uematsu. Anyone who's ever listened to the soundtracks knows that he's hit and miss and for one amazing track like Liberi Fatali, Man With the Machine Gun or the Extreme, there's completely average and even bad tracks. But it's got a bit more thematic similarities from track to track so it's more consistent.\n","\n","Gameplay: The ever-present annoyance for gamers and it all comes down to the Junction system. Each game has had different ways on how characters played the game. From the Esper system to Materia to the Sphere Grid, characters levelled up uniquely from game to game. VIII's different in that for one thing we don't have MP anymore. You \"draw\" it from enemies, getting 1 to around 5 or so spells to use with the limit being 100. While it is annoying that you can have a finite number of spells, I like the idea of junctioning them to your stats to make them more powerful or adding resistance to a certain spell or status effect.\n","\n","The other idea presented is the idea of the enemies levelling up along with you. No longer can you spend an hour beating enemy after enemy in hopes that the boss will be easier this time. Basically the enemy gets powerful just as you do when you level up so it's best to just be weak, as it were. Also, in previous games, shops or even enemies carried character weapons and armor that were more powerful than the one currently equipped well now the weapon has to be synthesized. Get a certain number of items and the magazine listing the weapon, take it to a shop and they'll turn it into a weapon. Of course you don't know what enemy even has them and you'd have to consult an FAQ to figure out who has what.\n","\n","On one hand, the game does have some issues, nay some huge issues but for some reason I think about re-experiencing this game more than the others which is strange. Might not be everyone's favorite Final Fantasy but for me it is.\n","Stage 1 summary: It's a completely weird thing to say that the most polarizing Final Fantasy game in the entire series happens to be my favorite of them.

Unreal Tournament itself has amazingly good gameplay, enough to make you sit behind your computer all day and play. There are multiple gameplay modes, like Deathmath, Team Deathmatch, CTF (Capture the flag), Assault, and Domination. Assault is a mode where the assaulting team has to overcome the defending team and reach an objective (one of my favorite maps for this is Overlord, a WWII Normandy beach landing map). In Domination, the competing teams must take over control points and rule the map. If the game itself is not enough, it also offers an easy-to-use editor called UnrealEd, and there's already tons of mods out there (like the acclaimed Tac Ops, which is included on this edition). You don't need a top-of-the-line computer to play this, either. I used to play on a 800ghz computer and it ran just fine in botmaches and low-ping servers. That's another thing: there's TONS of servers out there calling out for you to play on them. Never will you be unable to find a place to play your favorite maps.

It's a totally different racing game. This may be the racing game for people who don't necessarily like racing games. There may not be too many cars to customize or too many locations, but if you are just interested in the simulation, then this game is everything you need. You don't just race to beat the clock or to win first. It's more of a just-how-well-can-you-drive-really-fast game. But you know what? That is what's so cool about it! It feels like really driving at high speeds. Even the controls are set up that way: left top button to brake, right top button for gas. In this game, you get points for driving well. If you pass drivers up, you get points. You make a hard turn perfectly, you get points. You go through cones at blazing speeds, you get points. Imagine driving over 100 mph and trying not to crash! This is what the game feels like!  For some it may be frustrating. It is easy to make points, but it is also very easy to miss out on them. If you crash into something, you lose those points. You can get point rich combos too. But if you accidently hit something like a wall or a cone, you lose them on that turn... yeah it sucks, but it makes the game pretty exciting. You'll find yourself shouting out loud and you will want to restart the race just to get those points. The graphics are cool, the music is cool, and the game play is cool. Much like other racing games, the more you race, the more you unlock. If you don't give up easily, you'll find yourself playing this one for a very long time. The game is well worth its current cost, but you may want to consider just buying the sequel. It looks about the same, but has more goodies like online play, way more cars and way more tracks. But for less than twenty bucks, this game is great!\n","Stage 1 summary: This game is very easy to get into. That is what's so cool about it!

Where would nerds be without them? Final Fantasy IX is the best example of the JRPG genre yet made, a game that most everyone can enjoy. If one were to distill the essence of all those 90's RPGs into a single game and ratchet the quality as high as it could possibly go, this is what it would look like.\n","\n","Final Fantasy IX follows the exploits of Zidane, a dude with a tail, as he and his partners in the travelling theater group Tantalus decide to kidnap the princess of the kingdom of Alexandria. A young black mage named Vivi gets involved as well, as does the princess' obsessive bodyguard, Steiner.\n","\n","This simple plot description should begin to show you how Final Fantasy IX sets itself apart from other JRPGs while using the building blocks of the genre. Obviously, a kidnapped princess with an obsessive bodyguard is a trope familiar to anyone who has played an SNES-era RPG, but a travelling theater group? Another twist on the formula occurs when Princess Garnet requests to be kidnapped once she learns of the plan against her.\n","\n","Throughout the game, many twists on these formulas culminate to create a product that's strangely familiar, yet completely new. Final Fantasy IX has a great villain, as well, contrasting Final Fantasy VIII's disappointing Ultimecia. Other twists on famous fantasy tropes exist too- two of the major characters, both knights, are female this time around, when most are male. The game offers a considerable challenge, too, though it doesn't mirror the frustrating difficulty of the pre-Playstation era of the series.\n","\n","The game's ability system strikes a pretty good balance between customization and individuality as well. Final Fantasy IX features an \"ability\" system in which party members are taught abilities through their equipment. Since only certain characters can equip certain equipment, it leads to a diversity of abilities split between the diverse cast of characters. The system itself doesn't have any major problems; it works intuitively and helps to specialize the characters. In addition, the party can have 4 characters in it instead of 3. The more I play modern RPGs, the more I wish another one would attempt to up that number again.\n","\n","If the game has a major flaw, and I think it does, it's that of the eight playable characters, there is an obvious party of four that the game seems to want you to play with. While the game doesn't force you into playing with these characters after a certain point, deviating from the obvious choices makes the game unnecessarily difficult, and doesn't exactly \"work.\" A little more balance amongst the characters could have gone a long way.\n","\n","Since the four characters I'm referring to are so balanced as a party, you'll be playing through most of the game with them. This, for me, is far from a deal-breaker. Final Fantasy IX was a tribute to yesteryear ten years ago when it came out, and now it simply remains as one of the Playstation's best games. Since it can now be downloaded for $10 on the PSN, it's also one of the best games for the PSP. Anyone who has ever loved a JRPG owes it to themselves to play Final Fantasy IX.\n","Stage 1 summary: Final Fantasy IX is the best example of the JRPG genre yet made, a game that most everyone can enjoy.

The west theme is really incredible, with bars, a sofa called \"cow-ch\", poker games, and a machanical bull!

But I have to give them credit where credit is due.  Madden 2001 is possibly the BEST football game to date for any console.  I am not a very dedicated football fanatic, but this game is slowly changing that.  The graphics on this game are excellent, and they even rival those of the PS2 version.  The movements are fluid and are not robotic and choopy.  Each football stadium is done almost perfectly.  Even Raiders' stadium has an inprint of the Oakland A's baseball field.  The game play is probally the best it has ever been.  It seems much easier to control and a lot more realistic than ever.  Yes, it still gets frustrating when your receiver can't seem to catch a pass with noone on him, and then the computer's receivers catch passes with double coverage.  But this does not happen very often as it has in past Madden games.  The anouncers add a little bit more depth to the game eventhough their comments often repeat during the same game.  If you don't pay close attention to them, the fact that they are commenting on the game plays well bring you closer to the game.  I can now go into some of the minor faults of this game.  In addition to the commentators repeating themselves often, Leslie Viscer at the halftime reports ALWAYS has something to say about halftime adjustments, and that gets old very fast.  But I guess some talking is better than no talking at all.  Also sometimes, the receivers seem not to WANT to catch the ball even when their wide open.  However, that doesnt happen very frequently, and the whole gaming experience won't be a frustrating nightmare as in past Madden games.  Another frustrating this is that their is no way to restart a season game from the beginning if you want to start over.  Everyimte you exit out of the game before the regulation time is complete, the game AUTOMATICALLY saves, which sucks.  However you can always turn the power off on your computer during gameplay, but I wouldnt recommend doign this very often.  One final point about the game save feature, even after you win a game you have to leave it up to the computer to save your game, their is no save option where you can actually manually save your progress.  You have to depend on the computer to do it for you.  (I really got screwed by the computer.  I beat the seahawks 39 - 3.  However when I came back to the game the next day. I found out the for some reason the computer did not save my game and I had to play the seahawks again.  VERY FRUSTRATING).  If you win a game then I would suggest advancing to the next week, and starting your next game, and after the coin toss. exit the game and the computer will automatically save that game and all your previous games as well.  If you don't do this, you have to hope that the computer saves your game.  Also, you can't switch teams or have another player take over the computer control during gameplay and this sucks as well.  I feel that you should have more control in this game and thats probally one of its worst features.  But other than that I think that you will be very pleased with this game's graphics as well as gameplay.  I was very nervous about getting this game, due to my past madden experiences, but I got a very good deal on this game, and I am very satified with this game.\n","Stage 1 summary: Madden 2001 is possibly the BEST football game to date for any console.

Its a good mix of stratagy,action,and KOEI even through a little bit of first person shooting in there! Graphics are awsome, although in the heat of battle there is somthimes graphic break up and slowdown. Gameplay is outstanding! Despite what people say,you CAN do tons of moves...There are 2 main attack buttons plus a special attack, an in air attack, and a running attack...Plus you can whip together some wicked combos leaving your enemies stunned or just knocking them 20 feet in the air!\n","  There are plenty of characters to choose form, 9 starting ones and if you put in the right codes (or you can get them legit but i don't know how) you can get almost 30 fighters! Another cool aspect is the jump butten which will come in handy when your army is off pickin strawberries and your surrounded by like 100 enemey fighters. The enemey generals are hard, and you are often faced with the decision to charge in or stay back and fight with your fellow warriors. Much like an RPG,you get stats in this game to. The stats are picked up when a general is killed be it your own or the enemies .But weather you like hacking up dozens of enemies at a time with your weapon, or sniping them off with your bow, or just trampleing them on horseback, other than a few minor flaws (like the repetition) I strongly recomend this game for any1 that is familior with the Romance of the three kingdoms series or just likes to kill stuff.

There's no pressure to complete your tricks or point your board in the right direction long before you land (a la Tony Hawk Pro Skater), and there are no quasi-realistic physics to encumber a free spirit (a la 1080 Snowboarding). SSX Tricky is about getting an obscene amount of air and pulling off entirely ridiculous stunts while just barely nosing out another racer at the finish line. It's more exhilarating than 1080 or THPS while being a bit less challenging.\n","Briefly, you steer with the analog joystick and hold down the A-button to charge up a jump. During the last few milliseconds before a jump, you also charge up a spin or flip on the D-pad. Once in the air, your hands make a topward shift of focus to the L-, R-, and Z-buttons to pull off a variety of stunts, while you tweak the stunts or super-size them in Uber mode with the B-button. Completed tricks fill up your adrenaline meter and let you boost with the B-button when you're on the ground. During a race, you're forced to do tricks in order to be fast enough to finish the race. During Showoff mode, you're forced to use your adrenaline to hit the ramps with a good amount of speed so you can achieve more air and more tricks. Each character has tons of stats and boards to unlock, and solid replay comes from repeating the game with each character.\n","If I had to liken SSX Tricky to any other game that a Nintendo system owner might have played, I'd have to suggest the great Beetle Adventure Racing on the N64. If you liked the over-the-top courses, shortcuts, and personality of that game, you'll enjoy SSX Tricky. So far, no screenshots or videos of SSX Tricky have been able to convey the shear visceral thrill of launching your character off of the side of a mountain, having the music melt away into a faint beat while you pull off an incredible 1440, then landing perfectly to cheers, popping fireworks, and a musical crescendo. It's something you have to experience to get excited about, and I hope you at least rent it. I know my copy will keep me company through the relatively barren winter release schedule ahead.\"\n","Stage 1 summary: SSX Tricky is about getting an obscene amount of air and pulling off entirely ridiculous stunts while just barely nosing out another racer at the finish line.

Nintendo has once again delivered a huge hit that will be enjoyed by fans for a long time. Let's get to the basics.\n","Story- What's this? The princess being saved ISN'T the main part of the story? Well, she does get kidnapped a few times(I guess it was unavoidable...) but the game offers a fresh plot. Mario tries to have a relaxing vacation, but before he even arrives, Shadow Mario, his archenemy, as been wreaking havoc on Isle Delfino, where Mario plans to relax. Unfortunately, the town artist's drawing of Shadow Mario is in black and white, so all the people think Mario is guilty. His punishment is to clean up the town, and with that, his good name.\n","Graphics- While not the best on the GameCube, these are very nice graphics that remind me of the days of Super Mario 64 on the N64. There are some nice touches, too, that add to the gameplay, such as enemies exploding or Piantas(residents of the island) celebrating when you free them from Shadow Mario's paint. Very few, if any, graphical flaws make this one beautiful game to look at. 9/10\n","Control- The controls are very easy to learn and very hard to forget. Once you get down jumping much of the controls are already learned, and the rest of them are really simple, too. The one bad part is the camera, which you have to manually control, making it difficult in some areas, but that's not too much of a problem in most cases. 9/10\n","Gameplay- Finding all 120 Shine Sprites or those few coins, whatever your task may be, Super Mario Sunshine is a blast to play. You could be surfing on Bloopers or hanging from fences, even riding a roller coaster while destroying a mechanical Bowser(did it come back from Paper Mario?) and all the while you'll be having fun, which is what the game is all about. 10/10\n","Satisfaction- This game is definitely worth the money for it. Best of all, all of these intricate worlds and characters only take up 7 blocks of memory on your memory card, making it very easy to save. You will not regret purchasing this game, in fact, I've even seen some people get GameCubes simply to own this game. 9.5/10\n","Sound- The familiar sounds and grunts, along with some cutscenes with full voice features of Mario, the Princess, and any other characters around at the time. The music isn't obtrusive and is familiar of a Mario game. 8.75/10\n","Overall- This is what Luigi's Mansion was shooting for. They got everything right that was wrong before. The one thing that may discourage players is the aforementioned camera, but in the long run, the tasks are fun enough that even if the camera causes you to fall, you'll just want to climb back up again. Super Mario Sunshine, while reminiscient of the Super Mario 64 game, is a whole new adventure that's loads of fun to play and well worth the time to complete it. Have fun(which you will with this game) and happy gaming. 9.75/10\n","Stage 1 summary: The controls are very easy to learn and very hard to forget. This game is definitely worth the money for it.

Of course, I should have assumed this, since the GBA's 32-bit processor is only half as powerful as the Nintendo 64's.\n","This version of Mario Kart is really more similar to the Super NES game \"Super Mario Kart,\" which I never liked -- and I can't say I like this version much more.

I still rented it the first chance I got, and the reviews were wrong. The only place where the game suffers is multi player cooperative mode. This is really what made Halo so great, but in Brute Force the split screen seems to take away a lot of detail from the graphics and feeling. You won't enjoy this game in cooperative nearly as much as Halo.\n","Brute Force really excels in single player mode, this is more of a single player game, where you control a team of 4 and get to use their different guns and abilities. You will also need to take care of your team members or you will suffer later in the mission. One time a pesky bomb made me lose Brutus early in the level, and later I really could have used him to spot guys among all the fog, and this costed me as I spend a lot of medical kits. Basically it feels like Halo only it's in 3rd person and it's all up to you with 4 different guys and different abilities to use. The team members that your not currently controlling still fight with you, and let you know when they are taking hits and need medical kits.\n","Many critics of the game argue that the different abilities don't really play much of a role, and that you don't necessarily need them to pass a level. This is true to some point, I mean if you 100% needed a certain ability from a certain team member then you would fail a mission as soon as you lost that certain member. What it really does is increases the success rate of the mission by having these different characters and using their abilities wisely. And it's very natural, it never feels like your trying to solve a puzzle thinking what character would be good for what area, that's not what the game is about. The main characters are Brutus and Tex. Tex can get the best guns, using Brutus really helps your vision and you can spot enemies very clearly, not to mention recover HP while doing so. The girls play smaller roles, they aren't as good but that's not a bad thing. Girls probably wouldn't be as good in real life either. Overall it's just an awesome single player experience. It's the next best thing to Halo in action shooters.\n","Stage 1 summary: The main characters are Brutus and Tex. Overall it's just an awesome single player experience.

It has what a fan wants, a driver seat in the action of 750 horses marching foward at blinding speeds like horsemen fighting for position down a backstrip of Daytona. EA can't touch Papyrus's passion for realism. EA's version of realism is starting from 24th and winding up at 1st in 2 laps, 1 if you are lucky. Papyrus doesn't want to sugarcoat the experience, they want you to know both the pleasures and excitement of Nascar racing, but also the misfortune of breakdowns and failed engines. Damage is handled beautifully, smoke flows, rubber squeals, it's everything a Nascar fan could want, buy it now, for some premium racing. You must know the track and all it's grooves and weak spots, as well as when to use the draft and with whom and when to just rebel against an orderly pack and to carry others with you to create a draft line more to your liking and to challenge theirs to come out on top.  Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Steve Park will tell you how real it is, and you won't hear them saying the same about Thunder, plus you can get updates on your game and race over the net and make your own paintjobs, trust me, this is awesome.\n","Stage 1 summary: Words can't describe how awesome of a game this is,no, wait, this is no game at all, this is a honest to goodness transition of America's favorite motorsport to a breathtaking simulator that is on your desktop.

The characters look good, the controls are actually fairly tight and feature a wide variety of moves, and the storyline follows the Rocky films pretty well.  The whole thing is pretty entertaining.\n","For a while.  Then you start seeing the flaws.\n","First, the AI falls for simple combinations way too easily.  You can actually go through pretty much the entire game doing the \"jab,jab\" combo over and over -- the CPU will either block it (90% chance, which slowly wears him down), try to punch you and take a jab in the face (5% chance), or actually hit you with a jab, from which you will probably recover fast enough to hit him with your next punch (5% chance).  If you avoid the combos that the AI just can't deal with, it's actually challenging and fun -- but that's a pretty big hole to avoid falling into.\n","Second (and perhaps more fatally), the game doesn't make enough use of its movie licensing.  The core gameplay is actually pretty good, but if you changed the characters' names and looks, it certainly wouldn't feel much like a Rocky game.  They use a few short snippets of \"Gonna Fly Now\", but that's it!  Where's the symphonic score?  Where's \"Eye Of The Tiger\"?  Where's that song from Rocky IV that Survivor sings while Rock's getting ready to fight the big Russian dude?  Furthermore, the atmosphere of the game just doesn't seem to keep up with the storyline -- it always sounds (and often looks) like there are about 20 people actually cheering for you -- they could use some much better crowd audio and visual effects.  Compare this with something like Def Jam Vendetta, where they manage to do this much more effectively.  It's particularly noticeable in some of the larger arenas, where you can see that there are really about a dozen \"people\" that are just copied over and over (and move in perfect synchrony).  For a movie series whose high point was always the dramatic conflict in the ring, the game just doesn't capture it.\n","Sadly, I can't recommend this one for more than a rental.  If you really like it (and you might), you can probably get it cheap now.  But hey, at least it's better than most movie translation efforts you see...\n","Stage 1 summary: Rocky is actually a pretty decent boxing game.   The whole thing is pretty entertaining.

It's backdrops are stunningly real and complex, its movement quality is superb, and William Birkin, the big baddie is designed better than most Hollywood creations I have seen.  True, I would be lying if I didn't admit to the game's visuals as being outdated by today's standard; shattering glass and blood effects do look rather silly today.  However, coming out only a couple of months after Final Fantasy VII, one can see a character model boost.  Once one person said that graphics become outdated, but art remains the same -- these locations aren't polygons, or large sprites, they're coplete sets!\n","Another aspect I really loved is the sound. Let me tell you that I bought the soundtrack when it was on sale, thinking I would never really listen to it much. Then I learned why in the end credits THREE composer names were mentioned, the music is actually grand. The ambiant music is terrifying by itself, and the music during the scenes is quite amazing, and the end credit theme of scenario 1 is a very powerful track, I have yet to hear an equal, even from Hollywood and Squaresoft. Also, while the voice acting needs work here and there, it is a serious improvement over the original, and Paul Haddad, who plays Leon Kennedy suits the character and tone extreamely well.\n","Finally, lets talk movie aspects: story and atmosphere. Both: great. The story is rather unique, twisty, and sometimes powerful.  Strangely, I felt a lot of emotion from Annette Birkin most of all (the zombie creator's wife); I could feel the love she held for her dead husband (who didn't necessarily mean to kill thousands of people), and as I played over and over, I went from hating her to actually feeling really bad for her. Also, one particular character dies in two different ways (the two scenarios), and both scenes are very strong and movie worthy. Both scenes feature great music, and she dies in a different way, with the drama being delivered to you in different ways (you have to see it to understand, I can't explain well enough myself).\n","All in all, if you truly understand it, this is one of the few games that can be best described as an experience, as you watch it as much as you can play it, yet it still focuses on gameplay. My freind Sean owns this game, and can't stand playing it, yet he refuses to return it, since watching this game being played by someone else truly is just as good; he's proven it to me by sitting and not even looking away from the TV as I play for hours at a time when I play and he's around.\n","Stage 1 summary: sets!Another aspect I really loved is the sound.

That's not to say the graphics aren't good, but relatively speaking they are somewhat lacking.\n","This game involves flying combat missions to attack air and ground targets. You begin by leaving an airbase and crossing a map of the region to get to your intended mission.  However before you can actually fly the assigned mission, you must complete several \"mini-missions\" that might involve a dogfight with one or two aircraft and an attack on some ground targets. And in many cases, you will have to fight these EXACT SAME battles over and over each time you pass through an area. This becomes very repetitive very fast, and thus very tiresome.

Having not played the game in years, I was craving some Mario and decided to dust Super Mario Bros. Deluxe off; I'm glad that I did. I forgot not only how well this game transitions to the small screen, but just how many features Nintendo managed to cram into the game. There is huge replay value to be had here, which comes in the form of an additional full game, side challenges, and other minigames. While the original Super Mario Bros. was pretty challenging, the developers have added a save anytime and endless continues to ease the frustration level of the player. The only demerit the game gets from me is the fact that the whole game doesn't fit on the screen, so you have to move up and down accordingly, which caused me to lose a couple lives because of an enemy that I couldn't originally see on the screen.

The point of the game is to keep you finger on the trigger until all the enemies are dead. I know it may sound dull and boring but believe me it's not. It's a combinations of curiosity of what's next, great music, graphics and high paced action that keeps you glued to yoru console. There is no boring down times looking for clues. You pick and item and get 50 enemies showing up at once. You are done with that another 50 comes running. This game is fun. How do I know it? My girlfriend who is rather against violence (and video games in general) enjoys sitting down with me and playing in cooperative multiplayer mode.

It first glance, it looks so ordinary.  You look at the box and see that you are fighting a bunch of aliens with laser guns and assault rifles.  Sounds like a cliche doesn't it?  But what is so great about this game is that it is just really fun to play.  It gets all of the little things right.  Halo isn't innovative as far as setting and storyline go, but it is a big breakthrough as far as gameplay goes.  (Gameplay, remember that?) Even during the mind-numblingly repetitive spots, it still manages to be somewhat fun.\n","Here are five reasons why Halo is a great game:\n","1.  Weapon balance - every weapon in the game is useful, and none are overpowered.  Every weapon has at least one advantage, and one disadvantage.  The pistol is accurate at long range, which gives it an advantage over the assault rifle, which is lethal, but only at a short range.  The plasma rifle is good for taking down shields, but can't hold much ammo, and the rocket launcher is very powerful, but also slow to reload.  You can only carry two weapons, but you will frequently find yourself changing them out for various situations.  The fact that all of them are useful gives you all sorts of ways to fight differently.\n","2.  Fantastic AI.  The aliens in the game (called \"The Covenant\") give you some very smart enemies to fight.  They will use cover to let their shields regenerate and if you are trying to run them over in a vehicle, they will dive out of the way.  They will also use grenades sometimes to flush you out, as well as try to rush you and/or outflank you.  Sometimes they will jump onto nearby turrets or vehicles.  Not only do the enemies have great AI, but so do your marine teammates.  This all makes for some very exciting battles, which never quite play out the same twice.\n","3.  The game actually makes you use your skills and tactics, instead of memorizing where enemies are scripted to ambush you.  I love this aspect.  There are very few surprises in Halo.  Winning battles requires skillful use of cover, smart weapon selection, and good use of grenades too.  I am kind of spoiled now, because every other first-person shooter (except for maybe Serious Sam) seems inferior in this area.  Most games require you to abuse the \"quick save\" key in order to get through the game.\n","4.  In Halo, you are always moving forward.  The game just flows so fast.  This is due in large part to the regenerating shields mechanic, which is being copied by lots of other games.  This simple innovation means that you can fight 15 or 20 battles without losing any health, as long as you are smart when you fight them.  Thus, you don't have to backtrack all afternoon for a powerup.  In addition, the game throws lots of ammo your way, so you don't have to spend much time scavenging for it.\n","5.  Halo has vehicles and turrets seamlessly integrated into the game.  There are vehicles scattered throughout the game that you can get into and use to mow down your enemies or fly around and blast them from the sky.  When you get into the jeep, marine squadmates will jump in with you and take the gunner positions.  The vehicles in this game are so much fun.  Sometimes the best way to defeat a group of enemies is to drive around the perimeter and let your gunner blast away at them.\n","6.  Surprise, surprise, grenades are not only useful, but crucial to surviving the game.  This is thanks to a separate hotkey just for throwing grenades.  You can be firing your assault rifle and throw a quick grenade, and then fire your rifle some more.  You don't have to switch weapons to throw grenades, so they become that much more useful.  This is another very simple innovation that substantially changes the gameplay.\n","OK I lied, that was 6 reasons.  There are actually more, like the wonderful soundtrack, which makes the game's big battles so memorable.  Lots of people dislike Halo's repetitiveness, especially towards the end.  The infamous \"Library\" level gets pretty boring, but this is still really a great game despite being two years old and having some technical problems.\n","Stage 1 summary: But what is so great about this game is that it is just really fun to play.

I guess this title was made as an apology for everyone, which now has tons of extra features and gameplay modes.  The VR and Alternative missions are extremely addictive, and they start out easy but get way harder as the game goes on.  I have often stayed up late just attempting to finally acomplish one of these flawlessly.  Plus, there's also the addition of Snake Tales, which allows the player to go on numerous storylines as Solid Snake himself, ranging from normal to laughable to just plain crazy(one has Snake pitted against an evil dimensional overlord.  Yes, you just read that last line right).  Overall, while they don't add up to MGS2's storyline, they are fun to play around with.  My only complaint with the game is the same I have with every XBOX title:  The controls STINK!  It doesn't matter which game I play, the controls are often unresponsive and do not react even if I press multiple buttons, and as a result I often die in this game.  No doubt the PS2's controls are a lot better.  Still, even considering this is just a nice special edition of MGS2 with bonus features, it's incredibly fun to play.  However, I suggest that if you already own the regular MGS2, that you should rent it first.\n","Stage 1 summary: I have often stayed up late just attempting to finally acomplish one of these flawlessly.

The Suffering, on the other hand, is outstanding in every aspect - including the setting (a prison with a blood-soaked history steeped in violence and corruption). Into this environment, without warning, comes an unspeakable evil  - and here is where the gory tale begins.  Someone finally got it right when it came to translating real horror to the console game (Alone in the Dark, and the Silent Hill, House of the Dead, Clock Tower and Resident Evil series must now take a back seat...and I do not say this lightly as I am a big fan!!!). You play the game as Torque, a brutish killer on death row for the murder of his ex-wife and kids - a crime he has no memory of committing - who is suddenly freed from his cell when the carnage erupts.  I cannot begin to truly describe the sense of dread that you experience playing this game - and much of it comes from fleeting images, whispered voices, sounds of graphic slaughter, and the terror-filled screams of the victims (inmates and guards alike). It is what you do not see that is the most frightening.  Also the brief flashbacks that the protagonist experiences truly enhances the overall fear factor.  Add to all of this the moral choices your character is forced to make when he encounters survivors. Inner voices urge him to either save and/or kill them - and whatever Torque (you) decides to do will ultimately affect the outcome of the game!  From a technical point:  the sound, voice acting (especially the character of Hermes, who sent chills down my spine) and overall graphics enhance the gameplay a thousand-fold. Also the designers truly understand the importance of being able to easily save (ie. at the gamer's discretion not the game's!!!)  Only one quibble (and it is very, very minor): I wish there were more variety in the creatures (although the ones they have - designed by Stan Winston's studios - are truly nightmarish...and represent bizarre morphings of various methods of execution (hanging, lethal injection, electrocution, etc).

MOH features excellent looking explosions, beautifully designed levels, and great detail on the bodies. The overall look of MOH is breathtaking, you'd think with that much action on one screen you would experience slowdown, but that isn't the case in Medal of Honor. I've been playing the game non-stop and haven't noticed a touch of slowdown. Overall crisp visuals, great looking explosions and flawless frame rate, make MOH of the most enjoyable game too look at.\n","  The game's main stand is it's unbelievable gameplay. Playing this game almost makes you feel like you are literally in the war. It's main idea is to re-live WWII all over again, you are a US Soldier who is the best in his class who was hired by an agency and is out to carry missions. On your missions you will encounter German Nazis that need a little lesson, teach them one and keep going. Every stage has at least 3 or more missions to be completed and on some you will need to use your noodle a little. Since this title's main focus is the realism, EA has decided to include an array of weapons. Everything from a regular handgun to a shotgun and even to a rocket launcher. Besides having tons of weapons to choose from you also can take control over an enemy's machine gun. You may notice these powerful machine guns in almost every stage implanted into the ground. You can take over them by pressing Square and shot the enemies.\n","  Now that we have got the weapons out of our hands, I can now talk about tactics. First of I want to mention that the Artificial Intelience is incredibly smart, so you won't be dealing with idiots that don't even run away from grenades. No way, if you throw a grenade at the enemy he will either pick it up and throw it back at you or he will kick it away. In terms of gameplay this game can truly be compared to GoldenEye. It's AI is far more intelligent than that found in GoldenEye, MOH features a more extensive line of weapons than GoldenEye and the game (MOH) has a better balance. Medal of Honor actually features a good story line, and the cameras aren't bouncy. There is more to be said, but in the end Medal of Honor leaves Nintendo's GoldenEye in the dust.\n","  Here comes the greatest aspect, it's revolutionary sound. Playing Medal of Honor will definitely make you feel like you are in a movie theater watching some action flick, say something like Star Wars EP1. The game's sound effects are truly mesmerizing, every shatter, every footstep, every gun shot can be heard, and the clarity is to die for. If you have a big screen TV, and a powerful stereo system make sure to hook both up and play Medal of Honor, because I swear to you if you pump up the volume you WILL be experiencing World War 2. And last but not least the game also features dialogue during in and out of the mission.\n","  On the control side the game, it isn't really disappointing but control takes time to get used to. This is a 1st person shooter and their are controls to be learned. The top shoulder buttons (L1, R1) are for moving sideways, L2 is to crawl, R2 is to aim, L3 is to center view, X is to shoot, Square is to open up doors or take over machine guns, Triangle is to Jump, and O is to switch weapons. The lay out may sound easy but it takes some time to get used to.\n","  In conclusion Medal of Honor is one of Playstation's best titles out there to date, and it is very well the best 1st person on the market. Mixing, the story of Saving Private Ryan, and the action of GoldenEye, Medal of Honor is truly one of the years best games ever. Even if you are not a fan of 1st person shooters, I still highly suggest buying Medal of Honor.\n","9.2 / 10\n","Stage 1 summary: On a visual standard Medal of Honor looks great.

Wonderswan is a handheld gaming system (like the gameboy) that is in Japan only and has two ways to play the system (horizontailly and Vertically).\n","\n","Because I have been a fan of the FF games for a long time, I actually can say that this is my least favorite of all of the Final Fantasy games that came out on the Playstation 1. FF1 doesn't really have any main character at all, but has a battle system similar to FF4 (2 in the US for the SNES). FF2 on the other hand has a main character but the way the game plays (both on the field and in battle) is a little strange. On the field, when you talk to somebody, when it comes to important events in the game or whatever, you have a menu of stuff to choose to say. However, as you progress through the game, you get more stuff to say. The point here is that it kind of sucks to have a limited amount of conversation subjects and have to actually find more as the game progresses. The battle system for this game is like FF10 (only you don't get to choose what to raise up for your stats) and you don't have any level system at all. it's like the first game. the reason why I give this game a overall rating of 4 stars is because RPGs that were made in the NES days are really difficult and don't have much storyline and subplots in the games (like Dragon Warrior), and only have to do a few important things (probably 10 or 15 all together) before fighting the final boss. these games were mostly just to level your character up, got do some things, fight some bosses, level up some more, do other things, level up some more, fight the final boss. plus these games are way too short, because in those days, games didn't have a lot of juice (memory) to put in a long game so you can probably beat the game in 10 hours or more. I am so happy that I got to join in on the RPG train around the time of the Genesis/Super NES to the PSone era to a few from this era (PS2, GC, Xbox) because you can do a lot more with these type of RPGs since they can take longer to beat. I am not saying that FF1 and 2 are horrible games, they just aren't as great as the 16 bit, 32 bit and 128 bit eras.\n","\n","This game isn't that important to have in your Final Fantasy collection. however if you like the ancient old school RPGs from the NES era, this is recommended.

Despite the rather awkward name of \"Resident Evil\", which is just plain out laughable, the title has become a household name. This movie-like, horror series can be written down as a new genre of gaming, horror. Yeah, very few games caused gamers to devastatingly sob (Aeries' funeral in Final Fantasy VII), some games built mystery or suspense (Gray Fox's desperate attack and impressive dialogue in Metal Gear Solid), but Resident Evil led the player to leap in fright or frantically jitter. Capcom inserted blood-thirsty zombies as the adversary, and the player's fear as the biggest opposition. In a sense, it is a movie.  Useless to say, Resident Evil was among the titanic series that landed on the Sony PlayStation. The original game presented an amazing surface. However it suffered from terrible voice acting and a somewhat dull story. Capcom extremely went hard at work for their sequel. Powerful hype erupted when Resident Evil 2 was announced. Anxious gamers couldn't wait to get their grubby paws on a copy. Resident Evil 2 altered the gaming industry. Other home console companies decided to cash in while the genre was sizzling hot. Konami cashed in with Silent Hill. Survival/Adventure games went mainstream.  After RE2 respectfully lived, a third installment was introduced, this time hype was scarce. It came out too quickly and sources claimed the interface was going to be identical as the other two. Fearing the worst, the third installment seemed to be a horrible move for Capcom.  And is.  From the experience of the two Resident Evil games, the player may expect the \"scare moments.\" While playing on a big screen t.v., with surround sound, the volume almost reverberating the room, and a sudden pack of grunting zombies crashing out a window, I felt no fear. Amateurs to the Resident Evil series may have a chill ride their spine, but original fans will expect each scare attempt. Though few changes have been added, RE3 fails to take a leap over the original Resident Evil 2. In other words just imagine playing Resident Evil 2 but with more rooms and more puzzle solving.  RE2 is the strongest and most remembered in the series. When catching a glimpse of RE3, excitement was absent. RE3 seems it brought the entire series in shame. The story must take a new direction! Like taking a role of an umbrella agent, or the T-Virus spreading somewhere else than Racoon City. Nemesis, a ferocious, mean, bazooka- equipped devil who hunts the player, proves to be a pathetic antagonist and challenge.  The minigames granted after beating the game bring little life at the game's abrupt end. The slogan, \"if the Suspense doesn't kill you, then something else will,\" lives truly in the second game.\n","Stage 1 summary: This movie-like, horror series can be written down as a new genre of gaming, horror.

Most of the cast members from the show are here (Skinner, The Cigarette Smoking Man, & The Lone Gunmen), but they weren't used nearly enough.

Gone, however, are the kits that made Baldur's Gate 2 unique.  For example, rangers no longer have the archer, stalker and beastmaster kits.  I really missed that.

The Dreamcast VMU (Visual Memory Unit) is a step ahead in designing home system memory cards.  Included is a small LCD screen with working buttons to play mini-games along with other features (for example raising Chaos in Sonic Adventure or playing a Pac-Man type game with Namco Museum).  You can take the top off the VMU and transfer files into another VMU or link it up to play mini-games together.  The VMU can hold up to 200 blocks of memory, and while this may seem like a lot, most of Sega's 2K2 sports titles take just about 200 blocks of memory just to save options let alone a team season.  Not to mention that after a while the battery life of the VMU LCD screen will die, and that happens quicker than expected, but the LCD screen isn't necessarily needed if your just using the VMU as a memory card and nothing more.  All in all, I would recommend at least 3 or 4 VMU's for Dreamcast owners; they're cheap and affordable and you can still find them at game retailers.\n","Stage 1 summary: The Dreamcast VMU (Visual Memory Unit) is a step ahead in designing home system memory cards.

That's five compared to over 15 in Turok 2.\n","That and the fact that all the weapons have an aged, worn down look to them, for example, the Flak Cannon looks all rusted, whereas in UT it's all polished and shiny.

Doom 3! The game that truly made history. If it wasn't for sneak peaks, this game would have petrified players, especially those wholike me, saw it grow from the 90's. The PC version comes with 3CDs, a manual and even a disclaimer from id Software recommending and cautioning (lol) about playing this game in the dark with speakers on loud!\n","\n","Doom 3 retains its storyline of the UAC on Mars. This time though, the plot has more depth (I won't ruin it for you). The graphics of course have been much acclaimed. They truly are mind-blowing; even the machine for this game is. Monsters respawn if you backtrack but never in the same location twice! This helps in keeping you on your toes. Levels are also well balanced (although there are a few ambush-spots). Health packs are scattered throughoutthe level but now there are health can also be \"recharged\" around 10 times. These are found in special rooms on the walls. Also, Doom 3 now doesn't have the mindless killing like its predecessors. Now, the player has missions, some even as basic as finding scientists and PDAs! The monsters are diverse (each monster has a cutscene introducing them....and sometimes just watch out for hints...with your speakers on high), and so are the weapons (including the \"living and breathing\" one). Also, the concept of bosses is now more emphasized. So much for the pros.\n","\n","Now the cons. Storyline has depth, but there are 27 (around) levels! I doubt even the first Doom games had these many. The only variation of these levels arethat they either take place inside the UAC building or outside in the red heat of the planet (and that's not even for long anyway). Only the last few levels have some more variety. The player even makes a trip to Hell, which amazed me, but that was before I was made to go there again. Much as I love the monsters, I'll admit they aren't all...well-balanced. The Imps probably appear well over a hundred times (not exaggerating) throughout the entire game! The Pinkys on the other hand only appear 10 to 15 times. The Hell Knights make appearances even fewer than the Pinkeys. But despite this imbalance, the process of them appearing and them disappearing happens too fast. I rarely get a chance to absorb the \"evolution\" id Software has effected upon these monsters. Most of these appear in dark places, and they are very agile (except for the zombies but they get boring in while) and move very fast. They also evaporate after being killed (or the PC'd collapse integrating all the corpses into its memory). The darkness, though very important in setting up the eerie atmosphere inthe game, gets a little redundant as the player has to constantly switch from flashlight to weapon. But I think there is a patch that tapes the flashlight on the pistol =).\n","\n","Even though it might seem that this game has more cons than pros, every gamer must do it justice by experiencing it!\n","Stage 1 summary: This helps in keeping you on your toes.

A word of warning, however:  Shinobi is not in the least for casual gamers, i.e., those who are unwilling to be trounced time and time again before being able to successfully complete a level or defeat a boss, and/or those disdainful of gameplay mechanics or control schemes that are in any way a departure from the norm.\n","\n","The player-character, Hostuma, controls very responsively and has a host of groovy ninja moves at his disposal, including wall running, double jumping and a very neat dashing ability which can be executed consecutively on the ground, once in the air under normal circumstances, and an additional time immediately after striking an opponent while airborne.  This means that if you have a swarm of aerial opponents about you, you can leap to one, strike him down, dash to the next, and repeat until the entire group is decimated, all without touching the ground.  Hostuma's dash also has another, special application, aside from the fairly standard uses of evading attacks, reaching and attacking enemies quickly, and traveling longer distances in the air by combining it with double jumping every time Hotsuma dashes, he leaves behind an after-image.  If you dash away from an enemy and leave them standing before an after-image, most of the time the foe will attack it instead of pursuing you, giving you a window of opportunity to strike.  This can be a life-saver at times (particularly on Level 3-A, in which you are set upon by hordes of highly aggressive, sword-wielding zombie dogs).\n","\n","Even with just the mechanics described above, Shinobi would have had very good gameplay.  What really makes the gameplay great, however, is the Tate (pronounced tah-tay) system, the proper employment of which allows you to cut down a large group of opponents quickly with a minimum of hassle.  Every time you defeat a foe who is by his lonesome, he falls immediately.  However, if you are fighting two or more foes, each foe leading up until the last will be frozen in place a short time after defeat and your sword will become just a little stronger, making it much easier to \"freeze\" successive foes.  After the last opponent falls, or when you wait too long before defeating the next -- at which time the frozen enemies fall regardless of those remaining -- your sword returns to its original power, so it is in your best interest to hit your enemies as quickly as possible.  Killing three or fewer enemies in rapid succession, however, while advantageous because of your sword's power accretion, is not a true Tate; that comes into play when you quickly defeat four or more opponents, whereupon you are rewarded with a stylish cutscene in which Hostuma performs a sword flourish and all enemies fall together.  It is especially advantageous to attack all the weakest enemies of a group first, since that makes it easier to down the real toughies, direct, drawn-out confrontations with whom might result in significant damage to yourself.  In fact, some tougher foes take much more trouble and time to defeat if you don't Tate them.  This goes doubly true for the bosses; it is far more satisfying, but far quicker to defeat a boss by quickly freezing the various demons he/she has conjured until you have amassed enough power to Tate the big baddy along with them.  Nothing feels more awesome than vanquishing a big, bad boss beast with one sword stroke!  A final word about Tate:  Hotsuma's demon sword, Akujiki, requires constant nourishment in the form of dark energy, which you gain automatically upon defeating a foe.  Wait too long between feedings, and the sword will begin to drain your life.  A Tate however, will usually fill up your sword's hunger gauge, and if you make it a habit to Tate whenever possible, Akujiki will almost never go vampiric on you.\n","\n","Shinobi's graphics are quite simple when compared to most games of its generation, but they are beautiful in that simplicity.  There is no gross over-texturing, as evident in disappointments like Halo 2 and The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, as each object is textured just enough to give it personality.  Also, neither the character models nor environments are polygon-rich, but the hard angles resulting from the relatively low-poly count never look ugly, having been placed so that they fall into line with the game's art design.  Due to this graphical economy, slow-down is almost completely absent.  The dark, brooding colors highlighted by bright neons, along with the game's unusual character and enemy designs, lend the game an 80's anime aesthetic.  Since all of the game's character models have so much personality in-game, it is easy to imagine that they lost little in the translation from design to implementation; the enemies, and most especially the boss characters, are all very interesting to look at and well-animated, and Hotsuma himself, with his flowing red scarf, four-eyed helmet and confident demeanor, will surely go down in video game history as one of the most stylish player-characters ever.\n","\n","Overall, Shinobi's sound is exceptional.  The grunts, slashes, clashes, explosions and the like are all pretty standard, though never inadequate. The chorus of death cries let out by a flock of enemies during Tate, however, is really titilating!  The Japanese voice acting, though there is little of it, is excellent, and really lends itself to atmosphere-building.  Kudos to Sega's U.S. branch for not excluding the Japanese track and forcing us to listen to the kind of lack-luster English dub-drivel that has marred many a game imported from Japan!  By far the best part of Shinobi's sound is its wonderful techno music.  It has a fast enough pace to perfectly compliment the quickly-moving gameplay, yet is so thoughtfully composed that at the same time it projects an atmosphere of complex mysticism.\n","\n","If you are up to the challenge, I cannot recommend this game enough.  I am at a loss to understand why so many supposedly hardcore gamers, even editors at some major video game review mags, regard it shabbily.  I can only surmise that they are indeed not hardcore gamers, that they are only willing to scarf down one deriviative FPS or cookie-cutter sports title after another, completely unknowing of what a great Action/Adventure truly is. What happened to you, Sega?  Put Sonic on ice for a while and get back to making games like this!\n","Stage 1 summary: The Japanese voice acting, though there is little of it, is excellent, and really lends itself to atmosphere-building.

I played Final Fantasy Adventure on the original Game Boy as a kid, and now that I've grown up into a gamer I figured I'd better go back and play some of the \"classics,\" and FF-VII was near the top of every list I could think of. So this review will be free of nostalgia, since I didn't ever play the game before two months ago.\n","\n","If you're reading this I assume you know the basics (this is an RPG, the first 3D Final Fantasy, et cetera). I'm also going to take for granted that you realize that is game is over a decade old, and as such it's a liitle unfair to compare it to today's games (though it has aged remarkably well).\n","\n","This is an original Playstation title, so it will play on your PS3 (where it's also available as a download from the PSN) and your PS2. You will only be able to save it on the PS2 if you have a PS1 memory card. I don't own a PS3, so I can't vouch for its saving capability.\n","\n","You're tossed into the action from the moment you start the game (this becomes a plot device later, actually). That made me wonder about if the game would be lacking in any kind of non-character-model cutscenes, but I was soon proven wrong: the cutscenes are beautiful, even by today's standards.\n","\n","The combat system uses what's called the Active Time Battle (ATB) system, a decent blend of turn-based and real-time. Each character has a time bar, and when it fills you input a command. Commands are executed one at a time, in the order they were chosen. Bars fill up during selection and sometimes during the execution (depending on the action), giving an element of real-time. I had a gripe with this system as the game went on, as trying to locate one of the hundred or so items on my list was getting my characters hurt, but the feature can be turned off without penalty in the menu.\n","\n","The story is pleasingly deep, both in the main storyline as well as individual storylines for each character. The list of items and equipment is extensive. There is also an extremely high replay value for a single-player game, as the world is so vast, the items so plentiful, and the rewards for sidequesting high, including Yuffie and Vincent (two party characters) and a wealth of exclusive items, usually materia (used to cast magic, add a buff, or add extra abilities) or Limit items, which give characters a sort of ultra attack.\n","\n","Though few and minor, the game does have its flaws. Perhaps the most glaring is the lack of save points (you only get one) in the final level, which is pretty bad considering how devastating a lot of the enemies are. The game usually is portrayed as 3D character running around on what appears to be a 2D matte painting; it looks beautiful, but occasionally is hard to figure out what's a path or exit and what isn't.\n","\n","All told, though, the gripes are far outweighed by the quality of the game. Yes, this game is a classic for a reason. If you have ever played an RPG and liked it, give FF-VII a try. I did, and now I'm a believer.\n","Stage 1 summary: I don't own a PS3, so I can't vouch for its saving capability.

Raiden is your typical inexperienced, over commpassionate, teenage hero!!!! He's very much like Luke Skywalker, who receives a lightsaber and suddenly possesses a power which enables him to destroy every vestige of evil in the universe!  Raiden, like many other hollywood heros, is unsuprisingly, a pathetic joke. I'm sure I'm not the only one who's tired of game developers producing young, inexperienced, moronic heros, guided by the belief that gamers will be able to relate to them better. If that was true, then why is MGS 1's hero, 40 year old Solid Snake, the most revered hero in computer game history? Now, I understand that Snake couldn't have been used for this game due to the storyline, but still, I would have preferred someone who was less submissive, who could be perceived as strong, and who wasn't a girl which Radien arguably is! Since Raiden is essentially a pathetic joke, it's hard to believe that he's the hero they make him out to be.\n","\n","Many people hated the MGS2 storyline, but I think the story could be percieved as fascinating by some or absurdly bizarre by the rest.  I suppose the nearest thing it could be equated to are those conspiracy theories that you find on the web, like massive underground alien bases, LSD experiments, mind control experiments, etc... If you're a fan of that stuff, then you'll probably find the storyline interesting.\n","\n","Other than Raiden and the storyline, the game is pretty good.  The gamplay, the innovations, the graphics (unexampled still) and the AI can't be faulted, it's just that some might feel that Raiden and the storyline have pulled this game down into the s******. The game's lengh is a problem too. But that's about it! All in all, the game is good, but it's nowhere near as good as MGS 1.\n","Stage 1 summary: The most unfortunate thing about this game is Raiden.

It's production values are great, oozing with 60's style, from the great voice acting to the campy music. It's only downfall are the somewhat dry moments of gameplay, near the end of a mission.\n","Gameplay: The action, humor, and style of this game make it addictive and entertaining throughout its 15 hour length. Missions can be finished by either stealth or guns blazing, and unlike its predecessor, the sounding of alarms doesn't mean inevitable death; you can usually blast your way out of a massive enemy firefight intact. However, the \"find the document/find the password/find the exit/find the briefcase/plant the third explosive\" style of missions really bring the game down.\n","Some of the missions are downright genius in their scope; the Siberia mission is wellintended, spanning about 2 hours, and featuring vehicles to travel on. But there are times when it DRAGS. You may clear out an entire enemy force and then be slowed down for 15 minutes, searching every corner and filing cabinet for the item that moves the mission along. At times it feels like Resident Evil where you have to constantly click so you don't miss any critical items. The Calcutta missions in the game are also exciting at times, but brought down by monotonous \"filler\" missions like scrounging the area for posters.\n","When nearing the end of the game, in a submarine setting, it becomes maddening searching through corridors, checking every desk and piece of metal for a shred of paper with essential intelligence.\n","It's interesting enough to play through and enjoy, and laudable for some of it's clever missions (the escaping Ohio level with the tornado is a real looker), but the constant \"find the item, move along\" style of gameplay becomes very tedious.\n","Graphics: I never thought the Lithtech engine would look this good. The outdoor environments are some of the best I've ever seen in a game. Facial animations and expressions are amazing, with lip-synching technology that nearly works. Graphics and effects are strong throughout the game, and the textures, especially in the Calcutta levels, are extremely detailed.\n","It's framerates are decent, and it appears to be CPU bound with a Radeon 9700.

The plot is a bit predictable at times, and the music/sound effects make me turn the volume off sometimes, but the graphics are lush and the gameplay really WORKS.\n","\n","This is what the junction and GF systems in FFVIII should have been.  A large part of the gameplay hinges on djinns, or elemental spirits which you must collect as you progress through the game.

This will affect what sort of special abilities the character has, the character's stats, their class, and, of course, what they get to summon in battle.\n","\n","The most interesting thing about the djinns is the fact that you can combine different elemental djinns on one person to produce some interesting special abilities.  Admittedly, some djinns do not do this when in certain combinations, but the idea is simply fascinating and opens up a very interesting avenue in character development.\n","\n","Anyway, the upshot of this is, if you are an RPG fan with a GBA, you need this game.\n","Stage 1 summary: I know I'm a bit late, but I'm in love.

The various terrains - from snow to sand to grass to concrete - are well done. The trees sway in the wind. The units leave little tracks as they move, the construction of buildings makes you really feel like you're watching an army base get built.\n","The sound and music is well matched and makes the game feel realistic. Controls all work just the way you'd hope they would - after so many games they really have that down to a science.\n","On the down side, the usual problems in strategy gaming exist here. pathfinding isn't always perfect, units get stuck against buildings or in chasms. The campaign missions help you learn your skills but aren't extremely challenging.\n","Still, as with just about every game that comes out today, the built in gameplay is merely a training ground for the real challenge of multiplay. There's no way a computer could compete with the challenge posed by a real human being with experience and knowledge at the other end of the map. This game really shines in multiplayer. The three sets of units are well balanced, and if you get yourself onto a large map with teammates and opponents, you'll be hooked for months.\n","Skirmish mode is quite fun too, earning medals for different accomplishments.\n","Definitely a great game for any strategy gaming fan!\n","Stage 1 summary: First, the good.

It's so bad that if you have a CD-RW or DVD-RW drive in your computer, the installation of the game will most likely purposely defect itself towhere the game won't run. If you have CD or DVD burning software, or anything even related, or any virtual drives, the same will most likely happen; defective installation. The game's \"Minimum Requirements\" are a lie since they're so low, and you need brand-new, up-to-date drivers for all your hardware. Not only all that, but the game straight out doesn't like some CD/DVD-ROM drives and thus won't install properly, or even at all. Ubisoft support does nothing.\n","After all this, you'd think they were protecting a really nice game. But, no. The game is riddled with bugs and crashes. Major bugs are commonplace, and the official forum is thriving with hundreds of user requests for bug/crash help. The game also spans 4 CDs (for no apparent reason - the game is very short) that seemingly randomly need to be changed (more copy protection). This leads to scratched discs you can't duplicate, thus you must buy the entire game again.\n","The game is beautiful and mildly entertaining, albeit short, buggy, and contains terrible voice acting and a horrid saving scheme.

MGS2 is without a doubt the greatest game ever produced and I am now going to tell you why. The game begins with an FMV. Snake does a bungee jump on to a ship which is the first location you play in.\n","The first thing you notice about this game is that it is visually stunning. Everything is done to great detail and it is all very smooth. The graphics will be hard to beat.\n"," You also notice that the voice acting is very good and that the storyline is excellently scripted.\n"," The real reason that this game is the greatest is the awesome gameplay combined with an involving plot.\n","As you start the game you will encounter your first enemy. You might sneak up behind his back and shout freeze! before shooting him in the head with a tranquilizer.\n","You might kick him off a ledge and then run downstairs and search his body for resources.\n","You might hide behind a wall and keep jumping out and shooting before diving back into safety.\n","You might fly at him with a cartwheel kick before running away.\n","Or you might accidentally let him spot you. It would be helpful if you shot the radio out of his hand before he calls his boss for back up. However, if you shoot the guy mid sentence then the boss might get pretty suspicious and send his troops to check out the situation.\n","You can use a first person aiming system for shooting and you can fire at fire extinguishers to release gas. You could use other methods of evasion, for example, hanging on to a ledge or hiding yourself in a cupboard. The enemies are pretty clever so you have to be well concealed. They might split up and try to trap you, they also follow bloodstains or footprints. You had also better make sure that you don't catch a cold because it isn't a good idea to sneeze in your enemy's quarters. Some of them even have shields.\n","The atmosphere generated is fantastic. Your heart begins to beat faster if an enemy is creeping up on you. Pouring rain and spooky music can help the suspense and also, you might even find a dead body in a cupboard which could make you jump pretty high.\n","Hideo Kojima (MGS2's creator) even has time to advertise some of his other products on locker doors. This game has no weaknesses. The people who say it is short have used some sort of player's guide because it would probably take the average gamer quite a while to complete on the harder settings.\n","...you will be pretty amazed when you get this game. It is worth five times as much as it's price and until a PS3 is released, MGS2 will stay the champ!\n","Stage 1 summary: You had also better make sure that you don't catch a cold because it isn't a good idea to sneeze in your enemy's quarters.

The single player story mode is fun, it starts off like all games quite simple and gradually gets hard, at some stages, extremely hard but every stage is beatable.  The multiplayer game modes, which can also be played alone are awesome.  The games are:  racing, pool, bowling, soccer, baseball, target, fight, golf, dog fight, shot, tennis and boat race.  The best of these games are target, racing, bowling, fight and pool.  You can play up to 4 players or play with the computer, but I warn you, when the computer is on easy for pool, they are really stupid.  Bowling is fun because it has different stages to play.  The crazy mode is challenging, I suggest you play normal mode a lot before trying this mode for it can get mighty frustrating.\n","In all, this game is great and is worth the price, I got this game when it was released and I still play it.

I completely disagree with the 2 people who gave this game a One Star rating. I have never had it crash on me. The graphics are absolutely awsome, with every detail taken care of. You'll see players take off gloves and helmets while the players on the bench fidget and the refs follow every play. With the Face in the Game feature, you can take a pic of your own face, then import it onto a custom player. You can also import your own songs into the game, so that they will play when you score a goal, or when you win the stanley cup. There are a few things that bug me, like how in All Star Difficulty \"Hard Hitters\" cant use the normal check, but the game is great overall. The trading is awsome also. You'll be offered trades, including draft picks and players, and you can see all the trades anyone has made. You can also see a rumor line, like the real NHL, of what some teams want. The drafts and player creations are also very realistic.

I have read just about every review available online and that is why I'm writing this review to sum it all up. From what I've heard, the Joytech 5.6\" is the best on the market, however that is only available in European PAL format making Intec the best option for those living in the states. Now it gets more complicated. Thanks to other reviews I read about this product on Amazon.com, I found out that there are multiple versions of this product. After ordering it online and instead being shipped a Mobile Monitor (from what I hear, that monitor is not worth the money), I bought an Intec 5\" model at a local Gamestop store. First of all, the box has false advertising. It said it had separate brightness/color control when it only had brightness, and one headphone plug (don't be fooled by the product image on the box!). Note: The 5\" model and 5.4\" are the same to my knowledge. Needless to say, I returned this 5\" model (it does not use TFT technology, meaning the screen display won't look right from the side). Then I finally got the fabled 5.6\" version! I had called a store and they told me they only make a 5.4\" version, and if you go to Intec's website, the 5.6\" is nowhere to be found! Well, like one other reviewer said, the 5.6\" was definitely worth the extra hassle in getting it. It has two headphone jacks btw (one on each side). The picture quality is superb (had it been RGB instead of Composite video, it would be as good as the Joytech, but because of this, there is occasional color bleeding) and it's build is better/sturdier than it's 5.4\" counterpart. I found the 5.6\" at Toys 'R Us, oh and yea, do not order it online! Go to a store and buy it (make sure it says 5.6\" on the box), else you'll end up getting the wrong model or worse (Mobile Monitor!)! Oh and as an interesting tidbit, it can only power the GC and itself in the car just in case if you thought you could use it with Xbox in the car without buying extra connections (unless I'm horribly mistaken).\n","Stage 1 summary: Ok, I have spent countless days researching which is the best portable screen for the Gamecube.

The whole game is a bit of a mish mash of CGI footage and actual movie footage which really makes the game feel like it is cut and pasted.\n","The CGI is pretty good though a bit foggy looking like the beginning of Resident Evil Remake for Nintendo ( meaning there is a slight blur to it all). The movie scenes are good but just seemed un-nesccary and really didn't add anything to the game (if i wanted to see the film id get that).\n","The controls are relatively easy and don't take much time to pick up. Probabely because you will be doing the same thing over and over again. The AI in the game respawn in certain areas and you will be contiunally shooting those damn flying machines forever thinking \" im getting bored of this\". The developers just throws AI at you with the occasional mission directive (like find Sarah Connors coffin)and think they have this new sensational game. No they don't !!!!!!\n","Don't be fooled either by there campaign that they have the REAL man himself and that this makes the game better than any other. Arnold really doesn't have alot to do with this game. Basically all Arnold had to do for this game was go in a sound booth for a minute say 10 words like \" excellent\" \" reloaded\" and so forth and here we have the result. A game that really is repeative in every way and has no real distinction over other Terminators games for having the big fella involved.\n","The environments are mostly from the future setting with black charcol skys and burnt building and out of 22 levels about 18 of these are all like this. Boring, Dull and just too similar for anyone to care.\n","And this whole first person shooter cross bred with fist fighting ????? Yer, it works and i didn't mind the bouts with the T-X.

I don't recommend the game to those who are deeply Christian or in  the clergy but if you enjoy science fiction and Final Fantasy you will love  this. Final Fantasy VII and VIII were just save the world from evil with  love element thrown in, although those two games were enticing, neither one  still matches Xenogears.\n","The music was done by Yasunori Mitsuda off the  Chrono Trigger music team and it is the best music I have ever heard in a  video game.

This is my 3rd favorite game of all-time.\n","\n","Graphics- 9/10\n","For it's time, these graphics are extremely crisp. All characters look really good on the N64. The only problem with the graphics is the cut-scenes are grainy due to being compressed so much to fit on the N64. They put a lot of work into making sure the rest of the game looked good though and it does.\n","\n","Story- 10/10\n","Claire Redfield is looking for her brother Chris Redfield. Chris led the S.T.A.R.S. team into the Mansion on the original game. Claire finds herself trapped in Raccoon City with tons of zombies and other strange creatures. Leon Kennedy, a brand new S.T.A.R.S. member, also finds himself deep in the city on his first day on the job. They meet up and go to the Raccoon City Police Department to escape the zombies. Little do they know, the zombies are there as well. They split up and look for survivors and then try to escape the city together. Each character meets interesting people on their way to escaping the city and on the way learns about what happened to the city.\n","\n","Sound- 7/10\n","It can't be perfect; it's an N64 game. Despite the sound of guns and walking being off, everything else works well. The music is creepy and fits the game good. The zombies and other T-Virus infected creatures sound very disturbing, in a good way.\n","\n","Gameplay- 10/10\n","You play as either Leon or Claire. Both of them have interesting stories and different gameplay elements. As Leon you will use Magnums, Shotguns, and Flamethrowers as your character-only weapons. As Claire you will get Bow Guns, a Grenade Launcher, and a Shock Gun. This means you will have to survive using different weapons. If you beat the game as one character, you will earn a B-Scenario that allows you to play the game from the other characters point of view. This creates a total of 4 games all in one. Not to mention the 2 secret scenarios you can earn. This game makes you tense and freak out at moments. The N64 version allows you to change the blood color and change the violence level in the game. There is also a Randomizer mode that changes around all the items in the game to make it that much more difficult.\n","\n","Difficulty- 7/10 (Note- This is how much I like the Difficulty)\n","This game can be really hard in some spots, but generally you are facing mindless zombies. The bosses in the game can be a really intricate challenge if you're not smart about ammo. That's another thing, keeping up with ammo on the harder modes becomes a huge challenge.

Don't let the description of multiple games with multiple characters fool you.  It's one game that you go through with various times with different characters.  The valiant  effort of a very non-linear storyline was marred by the fact that it was so  non-linear that the stories were often left being incoherent.  It's tedious  going through the same mini-quests over and over.  Most of the characters  could have been a good choice to have their own full game.\n","This was a  good idea, playing through multiple games where you meet up with past  characters that you played, but the games needs a huge overhaul in order to  give it more variety.\n","If you have a LOT of time to kill and are very  easily amused and find this game for very cheap, give it a whirl.  Otherwise, find a decent game or play Final Fantasy VII for the 10th time.  It will be much more interesting.\n","Stage 1 summary: This was the most boring game I've ever bought.

There are three new areas that your party can explore. The experience point cap is also up to 161.000 in this game, making it possible to gain 1 or 2 more levels, depending on your class.\n","The three add-in areas are: Ulgoth's Beard, a small town north of Baldur's Gate where more or less all the expansion adventures take their start from, an...island(trying not to reveal too much), and Durlag's Tower. Of these Durlag's Tower is the most challenging and interesting. Durlag's tower is the biggest dungeon in the entire game, and can be a challenge for even experienced parties. The other areas, offer some interesting information, but are less exiting to play through. All in all it is an interesting expansion, although not an expansion in the true sense of the word. But since you can sometimes find both Baldur's Gate and Tales of the Sword Coast in one package at a good price there is no excuse not to get it.\n","Stage 1 summary: The experience point cap is also up to 161.000 in this game, making it possible to gain 1 or 2 more levels, depending on your class.

Since it is ten or so years past the release date, I had to wait until I could find it new at the non-collector price.  During my long wait, I allowed myself to build up some pretty high expectations, for which I blame my disappointment.\n","\n","Installation went smoothly on XP, but I found a few things to keep in mind:\n","\n","- game did not work in compatibility mode; worked fine without compatibility\n","- game frequently crashed with a sound loop.  It is not your background programs, antivirus, or screensaver.  It is caused by your processor and is fixed easily by imagecfg.exe, which is applied to the game executable file and does not affect anything else on your PC.\n","\n","While the atmosphere, story, soundtrack and voice acting were among the best I have seen (five-star), the keyboard controls were absolutely zero-star.  I have played games with keyboard control before and usually don't even notice after the initial adjustment.  I struggled with these controls right up to the end.\n","\n","A note to anyone considering this game: Use the decimal point on your keypad to cycle Manny's focus in places where there are more than one item to interact with. This will make gameplay much more bearable\n","\n","The puzzles also rank a dismal zero-star. There is little in the way of logic that can be applied to most of these puzzles.  I ended up relying heavily on walkthroughs to finish the game.\n","\n","It is a classic game and I am glad to have had the experience.  If you liked Syberia, you will probably love this game.  If you liked Schizm, you probably will not like it so well.\n","Stage 1 summary: It is a classic game and I am glad to have had the experience.
