It might just be my pronation/supnation and these shoes just do not work for my personal stride. I run about 2-4 miles every few days. Average of 8 miles a week and then sprints twice a week on a treadmill. Just after running with these 3 times, I am having major back issues that I have never had before.

I road and trail run. I run on my tip toes on the treadmill and a lot of heal on the road. I am 5'6 169lbs with more muscle than an average runner. Built more like a sprinter than a marathon runner.

They are definitely a light-weight training shoe so I wouldn't get them if you are going to be doing a lot of running.

Good support and my feet stay cool all day, also noticeably light but well-made and long lasting.

I have worn them hiking in a pinch but don't really recommend it because the material is mesh-like and will let a lot of dirt in.

Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration.

What I've found is that lavender scents can be tricky. Some are intense and other times they can be rather weak or not even smell like lavender at all. The Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender Blossom Linen Water is one that sadly falls into the latter category. I sprayed it on decorative pillows and at first it smelled really good They got the scent correct. But when I picked up the pillow 15 minutes later, it was no longer detectable. I tried it again, this time sniffing it 5 minutes later. Sadly, only the faintest hint of lavender greeted my nostrils. I was disappointed as Im a fan of aromatherapy, but this product just does not pass the muster.

I poured some full strength into my diffuser and it did work then, but that means using a lot of the product. Id rather just add a few drops of essential oil to water. Additionally, Maison has some questionable preservatives (Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) and Methylchloroisothiazolinone (CMIT)) and FD&C Blue 1 and Red 33, rather than just pure scent. It does not come with a spray attachment.

To give you an idea of how scented it is, we received some of the Dove&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dove-Men-Care-Body-and-Face-Wash-Clean-Defense/dp/B009VGNYFM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dove Men Care Body and Face Wash--Clean Defense</a>&nbsp;and while I liked it on my man, there's no way I would personally use it.  The scent was just over-powering in the shower.

This bar though is mild in comparison and very pleasant.  About on par with the normal pink or green Dove bar soap that we sometimes purchase.  (I think the white has the least smell.  White Dove is our household standard.)

Second, I like how it didn't dry out my skin.  It's Winter and my skins a dry mess right now, but this bar doesn't appear to be making the situation worse.

32,5.0,False,"09 21, 2017",A2YB7DLC3FOR7W,B00W259T7G,Pamela V,"If you love the scent of Patchouli plants and oils, you will love this soap!  This is a huge bar of soap.  It measures 4 inches wide and is 2.5 inches high and over an inch thick.  It is a light cocoa color with engravings on both sides of the bar.  The soap comes wrapped in plastic, but the aroma is unmistakably Patchouli.

To me, the scent the Patchouli reminds me of ""Dead Heads,"" or followers of the band Grateful Dead.  They made Patchouli oil main stream.  But Patchouli is also good to fight itchy skin, and smells wonderful. It has an unmistakable musky floral aroma.

This soap is also Shea Butter enriched, which means luxurious softness.  Nothing I've found blends into my skin like Shea Butter, and I have been religiously using Pre de Provence lotions with Shea Butter for a while now.  Their products are high quality and make me feel pampered.  The scents are delicious - I am feeding my soul with these wonderful fragrances.

While women will love this Patchouli Shea Butter Enriched soap, it will also be great for a man.  Patchouli is quite masculine.

This bar of soap is great for putting in your bathtub.  Or keep a bar at the sink to lather up and smell good between showers.  It makes a great gift - an addition to a gift basket for men or women.  Heaven probably smells a little like Patchouli and the scent is captured in this bar of soap.  It's fantastic.","The Smell of Musk, Peace, and Love",1505952000

This mouthwash claims to help with inflammation and soreness of the gums. I'd say this claim is true. I wear braces and do get inflamed/sore gums from time to time. Crest Pro-Health For Life has helped with that. It actually soothes the gums. The inflammation goes away much quicker.

I used this in my WaterPik with great results as well. Normally, I fill it up half way with warm water and the rest of the way with Listerine. My orthodontist recommended this on account of the gaps I get from my braces, to clean good and disinfect the loose gum area and to help the irritation/inflammation. I feel like this Pro-Health does a better job in that area - it feels like it is soothing the sore spots and like I said, the inflammation, soreness and redness goes away much faster.

I did ask my orthodontist about using this mouthwash, if it would be beneficial to me in regards to the gum issues, since this product is meant for people over 50 years of age - I am only 36. He said it definitely could not hurt to try and would probably work well since it is made for gum issues. He told me to let him know how it goes. When I told him I believed it worked better and helped more, he told me to continue to use it. When he looked in my mouth in order to determine the adjustments for my braces during that visit, he mentioned to me that 2 particular areas look better than usual. The gum line at two specific teeth was always more red than any other area, even though it was never actually painful or swollen. Since I started using the Pro-Health, that redness has gone away.

To me, this product is very beneficial, while being gentle. There is no harsh alchohol taste, no nasty after taste. It is just simply a smooth mint flavor, just like the bottle says, that makes your mouth taste and feel fresh. In my case, it definitely did help with gum problems and for that reason I will continue to use it regularly.",Smooth!,1368576000

I have a Sonicare toothbrush so for me the head of the toothbrush fit inside without a problem.  If you have another model then there are adapters you can put on it so that you can clean any other toothbrush.  But since I don't use them, I can't comment on how well they work.

The cleaning itself is pretty easy.  Just put it in, make sure the brushes are pointed the right way, close the lid, and hit the power button.  Ten minutes later it is done and all those big, bad bacteria are dead... well, 99% of them anyways.

So, there you have it, it works and it is easy to make it work.  What more could you ask for?

As a note, I do want to comment on what another reviewer wrote.  Namely, that people have survived decades without a device like this.  And I'd have to agree.  That is why I mentioned in the title that this may be perfect for hypochondriacs while most people will shrug and wonder what the point is.  For me, it is more of an OCD where I like to be thorough on the things I do.  Therefore, when I give my brush a thorough cleaning (monthly or so) then I like to finish it off inside of this product.

The area where the water came out was small and the spray could be directed easily. It did not make a mess. It was fantastic for cleaning my teeth, which had braces.

Now that my son has some orthodontia, the dentist suggested using a WaterPik.

This thing is unbelievable. The spray comes out so fast and the spray is so wide, that it makes a huge mess. Even I, a coordinated adult, have a hard time using this without spraying down the bathroom walls, mirror, and countertop. This is a mess. I am worried the wallpaper will be ruined and will begin peeling off.

Tip: Put the device in the mouth, then turn it on. Try to use it with your mouth closed or nearly closed and shut it off before you remove it from your mouth.

After reading other customer reviews, to prevent possible leakage, we take the unit apart and dump out the water after each usage.

Do your research regarding other models available as well as this one. The customer reviews here on Amazon are eye-opening.

I wish they made the WaterPik like the original ones that lasted for many years and were easier to manage.

Update: One child has been using this for 16 months and it is still functional.

My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent.  That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit.  This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.
I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!

Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

This set features grays and blacks that are perfect for shading and blending.

I do have a few qualms with these markers:
-- the brush tips can be difficult to work with if you're trying to cover tight areas.
-- the markers tend to lose density when blended with alcohol; it doesn't take much either.
-- the markers don't always show up the best when using paper that is resistant to feathering, and may streak.

I had been using a special setting solution and printing my labels directly onto fabric but the results were not crisp and saturated.  I wish I'd thought of using transfer paper sooner! My labels look FANTASTIC now! Incredibly saturated color, crisp lines, just awesome! I get so many labels out of just one sheet of paper (and a large spool of cotton twill ribbon) that it's very cost-effective.  For other crafty types, these would also be perfect for ironing onto sew-in labels (my next project).  I can't speak to how they stand up in the wash yet, but I also read that if, after they've cooled, you iron again with just a piece of parchment paper on top, you'll remove a little of the excess ""plastic-ey"" coating and also set the design/colors a bit more too, but I haven't done that yet....

It's mostly true and there's some basic elemental truth in this title. People are people, and regardless of the time period or work environment, they still operate in the same ways and respond to the same incentives.

However, the writing is absolutely wretched. I couldn't wait to finish reading the book and plowed through the last few chapters by sheer force of will. On the positive side, the book is mercifully short.

I'll sum it up right here: Give your employees clear goals. Let them know early what success looks like and how they can achieve it. Give immediate feedback and focus on the positive. Actually care about their growth and well being. If an employee has a problem, tell them immediately, and make sure you make it about their actions, not about them personally.

People want to know you respect them as a person and they do best when they know what's expected. Many managers don't let people know if they're doing a good job or a bad job until it's too late to fix it, and too many focus on the ""no news is good news"" style of management.

Now I know why Hemingway is known as one of the greatest writers of all time.  I absolutely loved ""The Old Man and Sea"", but when ""A Farewell to Arms"" fell a little short, I had my doubts.  This was the one that finally clinched it in my mind that Hemingway deserves all of the accolades he's received over the years.  It's a love story that takes place up in the mountains of Spain during the Spanish Civil War which took place in the 1930's.  The main character Robert Jordan, is a young American dynamiter in the International Brigade.  Back in the State's Jordan used to be a college professor.  Jordan's grandfather used to be a great war hero, but since his father was labeled a coward, he has set out to try to redeem the family name.  It becomes his assignment to travel into the mountains of Spain, hook up with a band of guerillas, and to blow a pivotal bridge during an upcoming campaign.  Not being as familiar with the Spanish Civil War as I would like have been before reading this novel it was a little hard at first to try to figure out who was fighting and what side Jordan was on.  I then found out there are the Fascists vs. the Republic and Jordan is on the side of the Republic.  At first I thought that members of the Republic were Communists with the ideals they were preaching and since the Russians were advising them, but then when they said some disparaging things about Communists that made me think otherwise.  The guerilla band he joins up with is led by a man named Pablo who at one time used to be great leader, but recently has lost his nerve.  He no longer is as interested in the cause as he once was, and now would rather tend to his horses instead.  He once led this band on a successful assault on a train and everybody in the band still seems to consider this their crowning achievement.  Pablo is still very smart, but nobody now knows if he can continue to be trusted to lead them.  His female companion Pillar is really the one who has held the band together for the last few months of the war, but she lacks Pablo's cunning.  She says she has a little bit of gypsy in her and at times she tells people's fortunes, not all of them however are good.  She is very feisty and was probably something in her day when she used to date several matadors.  The rest of the band is made up of an old man named Anselmo who Jordan loves very much and is one of the few people he really can rely on.  Then there is a few younger men, a pair of competent brothers, plus a strong and loyal man named Agustin, as well as a gypsy who for the most part everybody considers useless.  Finally there is the young girl named Maria.  She was rescued from the fascists during the raid on the train.  She is the daughter of a former Mayor.  Her hair had all been cut off and she isn't as beautiful as she once was, but Jordan immediately falls in love with her the first time he lays eyes on her.  In war a few days can sometimes seem like a life time and the pair make the most of what time they have together.  Pillar had taken Maria under her wing and had been teaching her how to one day be a good wife.  She approves of Jordan and Maria's union and after the fighting is over she wants him to take Maria away from this place.  As the battle nears there are several scrimmages and some great fights.  El Sordo's last stand is very memorable.  Hemingway's descriptions are magnificent.  At times Hemingway switches back and forth between Spanish and English but it never seems to be a distraction as he always provides a translation.  There are things wrong with the Republic that eventually will lead to their downfall, but at this point in the war Hemingway shows them as just little inconsistencies.  For instance, the Republic doesn't seem to believe in religion, so it is ironic that all of the band still say their little prayers every time they are in the middle of a battle.  The people also want to rule themselves rather than be ruled by the government, but they have no trust in one another.  If you are not from the same town as these people you will always be considered an outsider and an enemy.  There are too many fractions in the Republic.  They have some good ideals, but they are unable to really bring any of them to life.  Jordan figures even if they win they would probably need to get rid of most of the leaders since the majority of the ones remaining are all incompetent or murderers.  Both the Fascist and the Republic come off as being very brutal at times.  I wonder what Hemingway's political views really were.  I believe he probably had some of the same ideals that Jordan displays.  This book will make my list of the top 100 books of all time.",Hemingway is Brilliant and this Book Proves It,1103760000

The first is an informal, completely spoiler-free commentary for fans of the series who want a quick judgment of the book.  The second is a longer, more wide-ranging review, which includes some mild spoilers about various characters' arcs and the structure of the book, as well as comments on theme and tone that may imply larger spoilers.  There will also be spoilers for earlier books.]

So.  Is it better than A Feast for Crows?

The question is a leading one; it assumes that Feast was a bad or a weak book.  I actually liked Feast quite a lot, both on first reading lo these many years ago, and on rereading it in recent weeks.  Considering what the evolution of the story had made it, I thought it was the best book it could possibly be, and that the author's atmospheric world-building and vivid characters were supplemented by a sense of encroaching doom, the imminence of magic and of winter.

But of course I'll concede that for many the book's relaxed pace and style was a disappointment after the ridiculously-eventful A Storm of Swords.  A Dance with Dragons has more surprises and revelations than Feast, but those who absolutely despised that novel will very possibly be frustrated by this one as well, unless what they disliked was the particular characters involved rather than the structure.  The beginning is strong, with a number of developments and answered questions people may not have been expecting, but after that the middle of the book returns to the significant but very gradual plot evolution that characterized Feast.  There are some atmospheric world-building and set pieces that are very effective, but perhaps not worth inclusion in a book that's very long, and focuses on only half the characters to boot. (Some of what seems irrelevant may turn out to be important later, of course.)  The climax, though, ups the ante again, with more sudden and shocking developments, capped by what I think is the best final chapter in the series to date.  The Winds of Winter looks set to return to the constant action and rapid development of A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords, and while some may wish that could have happened at the beginning of Dance rather than near the end, I think there's enough going on in this book to satisfy all but the most disaffected readers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

[Mildly spoilerish review begins here.]

Here it is.  Nearly six years after the last installment of A Song of Ice and Fire, George R. R. Martin's gritty epic fantasy, the new book, A Dance with Dragons, has arrived.  But in some ways the wait for this book has been even longer, as 2005's A Feast for Crows only featured half of the series' major characters, because the novel grew so much during the writing process that it couldn't be published in its original form.  The author originally hoped to published this companion volume within a year of that book, but the story grew more and other problems intervened.  As a result, A Dance with Dragons marks the first appearance of some of the series' most popular characters in over a decade.

Tyrion Lannister, the brilliant but increasingly bitter dwarf son of one of the realm's great houses (Richard III is an obvious general model for the character), has fled the royal seat at King's Landing after murdering his father.  Aimless at first, he is soon set on a new path by an ally of the eunuch spymaster Varys, who had been vital in his escape.  But the journey he faces is long, uncertain, and dangerous, and several dark developments along the way threaten to further his decline into cruelty.

Jon Snow is now Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, the organization sworn to guard the massive Wall against incursions from the frozen north.  Jon is determined to make the changes he believes necessary to meet the Watch's purpose in changing times, but he must contend with doubtful subordinates and the presence at the Wall of the rebel king Stannis, who seems determined to test the Watch's commitment to staying out of the politics of the realm.  Caught between the king and the Watch, Jon must walk a narrow path where a single misstep could bring disaster.

Daenerys Targaryen, last survivor of the realm's former royal house, is half a world away, trying to rule the city she has conquered.  She has three dragons and a large, well-trained army on her side, but Meereen's customs are alien to her, its people difficult to rule without draconian measures she cannot accept, and the price she must pay for control may prove more than she can bear.  Even the blood of the dragon is not guaranteed easy allegiance.

These are the three most prominent characters of A Dance with Dragons, taking up about half its length, but there are many others, including a few returning faces from A Feast for Crows.  The presence of those characters and their storylines gives the novel's climax an added energy it sorely needs, for the middle of the book is, by structural necessity, slow-moving, as various situations gradually approach the breaking point.  This pace may be familiar to certain frustrated readers of A Feast for Crows, who had expected something closer to the relentless action of A Storm of Swords, the third book in the series.  But A Dance with Dragons is undeniably more eventful than A Feast for Crows, and certain character arcs are structured to end in the middle of the book, which means that their resolutions come early and offer a jolt of action to counterpoint those arcs that are still developing.

Questions of plot aside, the author's characterization and world-building are as fascinating as ever.  Jon and Daenerys are very young, and unlike many youthful heroes in the fantasy genre, who rule nations or command armies when little more than children and do it perfectly, they have their flaws and failures as well as virtues and successes.  There are no unambiguously good or bad leaders in Martin's world, only characters with different personalities and worldviews who are all determined to manipulate the current chaos to their own benefit.  As rich as the milieu has been in the first four volumes, A Dance with Dragons gives us awe-inspiring new locations, as well as old ones seen in new ways.  The Winds of Winter may be the title of the next volume, but this one gives us a haunting foretaste of what that chill will be like.

The world of A Song of Ice and Fire has always been harsher than that of many fantasies, inspired by real history, less romanticized and putting as much emphasis on the cruelties and desolation of medieval warfare as on noble heroism and elegant courtly intrigue.  A Dance with Dragons is no exception, and the evolution of the story in this book is along dark lines, dominated by failures that sow seeds of chaos the next volume seems likely to reap in abundance.  The final chapters mark a return to the unexpected and fast-moving action to which fans have become accustomed, and confirm what many readers have hoped: that a beloved but delay-plagued series is, after a long middle period, finally entering its endgame.",Two Ways of Looking at A DANCE WITH DRAGONS,1310428800
193,5.0,False,"01 5, 2008",A2ENIQZX6VJYUM,0002257556,Jack Ridley,"As I post this review, I have read three of Lessing's novels from three time periods in her career. This is her first novel. It lacks the strong feminine perspectives, dialogues, analysis, and commentary of her later works. It is an interesting novel set in southern Africa on a small farm.

Doris Lessing (1919 - ) is the 2007 Nobel prize winner in literature. She has a score of novels and many other works. Her complex novel The Golden Notebook (1957), the conventional novel The Grass is Singing(1950), and The Summer Before The Dark (1973) are considered to be her representative works. I have read those three. The Golden Notebopok is a long and difficult read, not as bad as Ulysses, but not a simple read. The other two are more ceonventional and much shorter novels,

The book jacket on my copy had this note: ""Mary Turner, a frustrated white woman, and Dick, he ineffectual farmer-husband, confront Moses, the virile and enigmatic black servant.""

Having read The Grass is Singing (1950), her very first novel, I found that it is not as described on the book jacket, nothing at all. Actually It is not a romance novel that involves a black man and a white woman. I liked the book. It is a straight-forward novel and she uses a structure similar to a detective novel. In chapter one the crime is revealed to the reader as we might have in a detective novel, and then the author takes us back in time about 10 years and tells the story of the characters up to the time of the crime.

Lessing describes the personality of the female protagonist, a farmer's wife, in great detail, but it is a far simpler personality than we see in some of Lessing's other characters - in her works that come later. There is no self discovery by the woman, other than she does not like her husband and her situation. She is mostly just depressed.  Without revealing too much about the plot, the story is about a young woman living on an isolated farm in Africa, trapped in a marriage in which she has little control over.

What makes the present book a worthwhile read is the setting in Africa. This is a good read and a mostly conventional novel.","A Conventional, But A Good Novel",1199491200

Crawford,"Historians, they say, are either lumpers or splitters:  the former seek to make generalizations while the latter seek to refute and refine them.  Braudel strikes a balance between these approaches, at one time examining the economic point of view (and related theoretical controversies, such as the ideas of Schumpeter on innovation), while searching for historical examples that support or obliterate them.  He is a true master scholar.
This volume adds to the first, moving from living standards to the establishment and functioning of trading and banking systems, both by capitalists (holders of sufficient resources to manipulate markets) and the merchants and craftsmen who operated within these markets.  It is a crucial distinction that demonstrates how simple-minded the ideological argument of ""free markets"" can be:  the rich can and do design economic systems to function to their advantage.  You follow the development of international trading networks by Italians, Jews and Armenians; the evolution of banking and the handling of paper money; and even the influence of social hierarchies on economic growth.
While Braudel concentrates almost exclusively on Europe in this volume, which lessens the universality of his approach, it is utterly fascinating from page one.  The economic systems he analyses were somewhat incomplete, though evolving rapidly.  An additional limit to his approach is the exclusive focus on econimic life.  At times, he views the building of chateaux and the commission of great works of art from the Reanassance to the 19C as a reflection of the lack of wealth-generating investment opportunities during a time of economic revolution!
And that is just a few of the issues covered.  Each section of the book is like an essay on some basic economic notion.  As such, the book assumes a great deal of historical knowledge in the reader, though Braudel often explains what he refers to briefly.  For me, this added to its appeal and density, but it is often hard going.  However, the book is leavened by wonderful and fascinating illustrations, which eases the task of getting through it at times.

We learn in the book that Callie has lost both of her parents and a shadow/spirit has comforted her ever since with stories like the ones they use to share. Callie soon learns that that she is special and that there are supernatural creatures in the small town of Fairwick.

The Demon Lover somewhat slow and has a plot that is not quit clear. The incubus is banished fairly early on in the book, Callie's roommate goes insane, and the college is hit with a sickness that makes a lot of people there ill. All this alongside the predictable problems in her relationship with her boyfriend, Paul.

A new teacher moves to town and Callie is soon in a relationship with him that is fast moving. This relationship in the book has no build up to it except for one kiss.  Though she does pretend to hate him, doesn't last long though, and they end up spending weeks in bed together. You don't really feel much for this as a whole for the simple fact that it seems to be just sex and him being obsessed with her.

A side for the plot being unclear and slow the world that the author built was very enjoyable. I did also like the dark/gothic atmosphere of the book and that this book was strictly told from Callie's point of view. With this said if you are looking for a different book to read then I do recommend The Demon Lover, but also recommend you go into this book on a paranormal mind set and not the paranormal romance in which it has been said to be.

Djinns are ghosts and there are those that believe there are many in Delhi, Dalrymple gets the ghosts of the city to speak of the past by going through endless archives. One of the richest archives it turns out was nearer to him than he thought. His wife Olivia Fraser is a descendant of William Fraser who was a legendary figure in early nineteenth century Delhi at a time when Delhi was a place of perpetual conflict at the outermost edges of the empire. Fraser raised his own army made up of the strongest warriors from each successive tribe that he conquered and he ruled Delhi in a way not incomparible to Conrad's Kurtz(Dalrymple makes the comparison). William and Olivia stayed in the Fraser residence in Inverness, Scotland before leaving for Delhi only to find that one room away from where they were sleeping were stacks and stacks of William Fraser's old letters.
Dalrymple discusses at length the many great figures of Delhis past including James Forbes, Fraser, Sir David Ochterlony and James Skinner and after investigating them in books he then ventures out to find what remains of the forts and palaces they resided in.
Also there is much from Delhis more recent past. Dalrymple interviews many still living Djinns who remember the great atrocities that followed the 1947 partition of India and Pakistan where vast numbers of people migrating in opposite directions(Hindus into India, Muslims to Pakistan)began killing each other. Virtually all of old Delhi, once famous for its high degree of Urdu culture was displaced by a largely peasant population of Punjabi immigrants which completely changed every aspect of the city, including the language. A fascinating colony of the old Delhi-wallahs lives on in exile in Karachi and Dalrymple heads there to hear stories from the exiled Djinns, the last remaining voices of a once great city.
  Making his way further into the past through the travel narratives of the Italian Niccolao Manucci, the Frenchmen Francois Bernier and the Moroccan Ibn Battuta, Dalrymple brings to life the 17th century Delhi of Shah Jehan and the 14th century Delhi of Tughluk then explores what remains of the great cities that Delhi was(Delhi was rebuilt time and again, at least eight different cities one on top of the other)and finds sometimes tucked away beneath or within one of the modern structures of this much more utilitarian and mundane age, evidence of a once magnificent Mogul palace or courtyard or zenana.",twilight in Delhi,1015891200

SPOILER ALERT

Ben Cappadora is three years old when his careless mother, Beth, leaves him under the sole care of his seven-year-old brother, Vincent. One moment the hotel lobby is brimming with the excited, reconnecting guests of a highschool reunion; the next, all is horrified chaos. Ben is gone.

The story flows smoothly into the ensuing, rabid search, the slow slide into depression on Beth's part, the years of blaming himself and distancing the world on Vincent's, the ultimate conclusion that Ben is gone forever. The book could have ended there and still provided a satisfactory, albeit dark, read.

But it plunges on, swirling over and around Beth's lifeless, uncaring existence, exploding spectacularly upon the harshly cold misbehavior of Vincent, now called Reese, lapsing in peace for only a moment when the long-looked-for but never truly expected reunion comes. The joy, the ecstatic unbelievableness of it, ghosts away as quickly as it came, and the waves of bitter reality crash in. Yes, a son has been found... but not Beth's son.

Awakened into sorrowing heartache and endless confusion, Beth struggles on, unable to help either herself or her two lost-and-found, renamed sons. The family is torn apart again, never really made whole to begin with.

The book layout is the best layout I've seen of any Shakespeare book, and the size is right (you can take it with you!).

The story is legend - even speaking literally - apparently the story of Hamlet hearkens back to even older legends that predate Shakespeare's Hamlet.

Shakespeare is so quotable, and Hamlet is no different - you often find yourself saying ""Oh, that's where that comes from!"" and its like finding an old friend in a new story.  ""To be or not to be, that is the question"" is one; so is ""Neither a borrower nor a lender be"" and so is ""To thine own self be true"".  The book even comes with an appendix listing commonly quoted portions of the story and their source.

However, my favorite quote (but not well-known) from the play comes from Hamlet himself, and sums the character up well:

The book is definitely not to the standards of the first three, but it is much more exciting and fun then the dreadful 4th book in the series. The pacing can be quite slow and it appears that there are several throw away chapters (and characters) but one can only assume that GRRM is building toward something great for the next two books. The crap in the middle of the series can be painful to suffer through though. 2,000 pages I've read that I'll never get back. That being said with the bad, there is much good in this book.

Since people are usually pretty good about discerning when they are being taken advantage of, the whole slew of caustically negative reviews surrounding this book should come as no surprise. In the immortal words of Randall Patrick McMurphy:""When a man's getting screwed he has a right to holler.""

Hundreds of reviews point to similar truths.
1)A Dance With Dragons contains little to no real plot advancement. This is especially infuriating when the novel is the size of a phone-book. To write a near thousand page novel where ""nothing much happens"" takes a certain amount of craftsmanship, I'll grudgingly admit.
2)Martin's stall tactics are enabled through character assassination. Tyrion and Dany are practically unrecognizable, having seemingly lost their strength and resolve. If these characters had retained spunk and a sense of agency, Martin might have been forced to take the story a discernible direction. Hence, Martin mangled them beyond recognition.
3)This long, uneventful book relies on plenty of ""world building"" filler, in the form of tedious, mind-numbing descriptions. It also relies on maintaining the interest of the reader through plenty of lowest common denominator gutter tactics, in the form of excessive and gratuitous sex and violence.
4)Unlike the first 3 books of the series, Martin did not seem to enjoy writing this book. Hence, the writing is weary, uninspired, and sleep inducing. (I think he tried to make up for this by talking excessively about food, which he obviously does love. Unfortunately, this did not improve the book, it merely contributed to the bloat.)

Oddly enough, there is a common point of view expressed by many of this book's defenders, and even by some of its detractors. This point of view is basically that ""A Dance With Dragons may not be up to the quality of some of the other books in the series, but a bad George Martin book is still better than almost any other fantasy book out there.""

I totally disagree.

The world of Fantasy Fiction is full of wonderful authors worth reading. Whether one is talking about relatively neglected geniuses of the past like E.R. Eddison or Fritz Leiber, or obvious choices like Tolkien or LeGuin, or contemporary figures like Tim Powers or Robin Hobb, there is no dearth of first rate material.

It is mystifying to me why many people tend to assume that George Martin is the standard bearer, the best the genre has to offer. This assumption does not bear scrutiny. Sure, I really enjoyed the first three books of this series and consider them very good, but even Martin at his best seems to suffer from a defective worldview: nihilism masquerading as realism.

Even if one puts the first 3 books of this series high in the fantasy pantheon, there is no getting around the fact that A Dance With Dragons fails on many levels. It is much worse then the misstep that was book 4. In fact, I am hard pressed to think of a worse fantasy book. What is particularly galling and pernicious is that the mainstream media has decided to jump on the Martin bandwagon and give A Dance With Dragons laudatory reviews. (I'm sure marketing considerations has nothing to do with it...) Not only is an overrated author getting an excessive amount of attention, but newcomers to the fantasy genre may well give up on the genre entirely if they read Martin's train wreck of a series under the false assumption that this is the epitome of fantasy.

I would like to forget about A Song of Ice and Fire entirely. Unfortunately, the HBO series and accompanying marketing blitz ensures that Mr. Martin and his series will be the topic of conversation for some time to come.

Well, then here are my two cents: George Martin has become the contemporary Darth Vader of the Fantasy world. His influence is toxic. He is a powerful villain in the Fantasy Fiction Galaxy. He exploits his fan base, he crafts inferior works designed NOT to advance a story, he utilizes a vast marketing machine to sell a series that even in its best moments contains an ugly and erroneous world view and which in its worst moments panders to very vulgar tastes,  he insulates himself from criticism, he stigmatizes those who have criticisms, he gives fantasy fiction a bad name.

Come to think of it, I don't think Fantasy Fiction even had a Darth Vader prior to GRRM. No other genre author I am aware of merits the negative reaction that Martin so richly deserves. Congratulations, Mr. Martin, on this singular accomplishment!",The Darth Vader of Fantasy,1337817600

I own a rare out-of-print version. The one I own is the original vinyl version. That one drops 'Candle Of The Wind' and has the other 10 songs. But I do know the song well, so that's not a problem (for me).

This set spans 'Elton John' to 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.' Surprisingly, 'Tumbleweed Connection' and 'Madman Across The Water,' two of his most popular records of the early 1970s, do not get any representation here, which hurts the compilation a little bit.

'Tiny Dancer,' 'Levon,' 'Burn Down The Mission' and 'Take Me To The Pilot' (from 11/17/70) all would fit nicely here.

But, what's here is excellent. 'Your Song,' 'Daniel,' 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,' 'Rocket Man,' 'Honky Cat,' and 'Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me' all appear here. And, those are my favorite Elton songs, so it works out perfectly!

The only thing missing is the original record sleeve photo of the Moody Blues in concert.

As musicians, lyricists and singers, the Moody Blues were at their zenith in ""Every Good Boy Deserves Favour"". The idealistic message of peace and love is evident here amidst lyrics dealing with alienation, rejection, futility, compassion, creation and mysticism. Their trademark fusion of rock and classical music is prominent in their Moog synthesized orchestrations and strong vocal harmonies.

While the title ""Every Good Boy Deserves Favour"" is a direct reference to how one learns to remember the sonic scales (E, G, B , D, F) - a scale repeated throughout the album, using the Moog synthesizer - it is also an apt thesis that defines the lyrical content of the album. That is to say, humanity deserves better despite the trails and tribulations encountered in life.

The songs:

""Procession"" is an instrumental piece that opens with a cosmic (Moog) whir, then dissolves to a wind blowing over a still, desolate atmosphere. Thunderclaps and rainfall break the silence, then yield to the sound of droning insects and chirping birdsong. The sonic scale played on piano, note for note, is layered on top of these sounds, effectively becoming the musical a priori imprinted in man's psyche; one that impels him to tap a succession of drumbeats and utter communicative grunts. On discovery of rhythm and vocal harmony, man's `procession' sees him structuring a melody with sitar, flute, harpsichord and organ - instruments which identify not periods in time but the musical ethnicity of India, China and Europe, and hence the universality of music. Essentially, it's ""In Search Of The Lost Chord"" rediscovered and found.

Building on the crescendo of ""Procession"", an electric guitar rips into ""The Story In Your Eyes"". A rousing and infectious Hayward rocker, the lyrics describe a bleak and uncertain future that was plausible in 1971, given the Vietnam War, street protests, over population, pollution and nuclear proliferation. Yet, amidst this angst-filled backdrop comes a hopeful note from the singer, ""I can hide inside your sweet, sweet love for evermore"".

""Our Guessing Game"" is a reflective Thomas composition about dreams deferred, opportunities missed and the uncertainty of the consequence, all of which creates a sense of unhappiness and futility in life...""Our Guessing Game"". Despite the quandary in life Thomas sings about, there lies a glimmer of optimism when juxtaposed against the Moody Blues' singing, ""Bless the days when I'm feeling strong"".

""Emily's Song"" is a lullaby Lodge wrote for his newborn daughter (Emily). Strangely, if one were not aware of this fact, the song with its gentle melody could quite easily pass as an ordinary love song.

""After You Came"" is a powerful percussion piece from drummer, Graeme Edge, expressing the ups and downs in life and learning to ""laugh when it hurts so hard"".

""One More Time To Live"" evokes a dark and foreboding indictment of man and his ""world passing by"". Consider the cause-and-effect relationship of the lines, ""Turn the earth to sand and still commit no crime / How one thought will live provide the others die."" To drive the point home Lodge sings, ""I have riches more than these"", such as ""degradation, pollution, population, illusion, annihilation, revolution, starvation"". In spite of these environmental and socio-political ills, man can improve his condition with ""contemplation, communication, compassion, salvation, elation, solution"".

""Nice To Be Here"" is a rather whimsical song, as if a nursery rhyme for a child, what with Thomas describing various animals harmonizing their voices and antics to create a symphony amidst a forest. It's a truly delightful song with an up temp and playful bass line.

""You Can Never Go Home"" is very simply Hayward saying, to quote another song of his, ""I believe what is lost is lost forever"".

""My Song"" is Pinder's plea for ""a planet with one mind""...""before it's too late"". The middle instrumental passage is `Cosmic Rock' at its best and very reminiscent of an earlier Pinder song, ""The Voyage"".

The music is all original, written by Yanni and played by a proffessional symphony orchestra. The setting is in both India's Taj Mahal and the Forbidden City in China. It was the first live concert ever played in the two settings, and there was a lot of red tape that the producers had to go through in order to get the authority to play in front of these monuments.

Also featured are violinist Karen Briggs and woodwind instrumentalist Pedro Eustache. Both are superb improvisational soloists and really add to the entertainment factor of the show. There are also four female singers, all of whom are excellent in their own way, and are featured both as soloists and providing background harmony.

Yanni's talent, along with being a prolific pianist, composer and arranger, is bringing great musicians together and directing them in a way to fully exploit each musicians unique and individual sound. His band contains musicians from all over the globe, and is something of a ""United Nations"" band.

For these reasons, I enjoyed this DVD much more than any other Yanni's other material. Most of his albums that I have heard thus far are just him playing, using synthesizers and drum machines to try to get the sound that he wants. Where this gives him the opportunity to explore the art of composing, there is nothing like hearing the music come alive with real musicians and orchestrations of what he wants to do.

I also compare this album to ""Live at the Acropolis,"" and feel that buying this DVD would be a much better purchase. I think that Yanni's music was still in the developmental stage when he recorded at the Acropolis; with ""Tribute,"" he has had a chance to try things out, and this is the culmination of all his years of hard work as a composer and arranger.

Dressed To Kill seemed to have the opposite problem that the first two Kiss records had....both of those albums had great, great songs, but were badly recorded, and the band sounded a bit sloppy on them. Dressed To Kill, however, has a terrific sound (especially the guitars) and the band sounds much tighter, but the songs...for the most part...aren't as consistently good..or great. The first three songs are filler..at least to me, even though for filler, they're still not that bad. Very rock and roll oriented, good solid drumming and the lyrics, about getting good room service and two timing women, and ladies who are waiting in the ladies room for you, are what one would expect on a KISS album. I must say though that 'Room Service' may be one of the weakest lead off songs on a Kiss album. Of the next two Gene songs, I would say 'Two Timer' is the better of them, due mainly on the strength of it's bridge.

Things finally start to pick up (and how!) with Frehley's 'Getaway', one of my favorite songs of his. I particularly like Gene's wandering but melodic bass line during the verses. Catchy riff, short, but brilliant solo and a cool vocal from Peter. 'Rock Bottom' has acoustic guitars making their debut on a Kiss album during Frehley's instrumental intro. I do prefer the version of this from Alive better...they shorten the intro and the song just sounds tougher and meaner. I also prefer the live version of 'C'Mon and Love Me', because Paul's vocal is more meaty on it. Still, this is a damn catchy song and this version is still quite listenable. I particularly love the lead guitar playing, some of which is done by Paul.

Of the rest...Gene likes the song 'Anything For My Baby' because he thinks Paul sounds like a man on it! I must say that Paul's vocals did improve on this album. I also think Paul was improving as a song writer around this time. Short on material, Gene and Paul dug into their Wicked Lester catalogue for the next two songs, 'She' and 'Love Her All I Can'. The latter is my favorite tune on the album...both Peter and Ace really wail on this song on their respective instruments. And...well, you've heard the last song, right? Once again, I like the version from Alive better...and I also love the way Ace sings the first part of the second verse on MTV Unplugged!

It is a very short album...the whole thing only clocks in at around 30 minutes, but you know, it's quality over quantity. Look at Hot In The Shade...that's about an hour long and has only three or four really good songs on it. Dressed To Kill is a way cool Kiss album. ROCK AND ROOOOOLLL!!",Suit alore!!!,1189209600

Florence Ballard was the original lead singer. Several singles were released without success, after which Diana Ross replaced Florence as lead singer. Songwriters Holland-Dozier-Holland were brought in at the same time and nobody will ever know which change was the most significant. Florence eventually left the Supremes, to be replaced by Cindy Birdsong. Diana Ross left to go solo in 1970, at which point this compilation ends.
The Supremes had just one British number one hit (Baby love) but they had many number ones in the American pop charts. Many of those were also top ten hits in Britain, but even those that weren't became famous anyway.

After all, she had the Notorious B.I.G. seal of approval and she and Biggie were the only ones worth listening to on their Junior M.A.F.I.A. album. How is the album? Well, let's just say that it isn't nice to return a Christmas gift from someone.
Don't get me wrong, this album got mad beats (virtually every song was played at house parties on campus), but when I sat down and listened to what was being said, I wasn't impressed. It sounds like Lil' Kim was using XXX-rated lyrics to hide any kind of real talent, hence calling it ""shock value"". Songs like the Jermaine Dupri-laced ""Not Tonight"" (though I can't front on the clever use of the ""Turn Your Love Around"" sample) and ""We Don't Need It"" make me wanna throw up. I wondered if she was kicking these songs for the guys because it's sexy, or for the girls because it's never been done before.
There are some songs that I can stand like ""No Time"", ""Big Momma Thang"" (featuring then almost-famous Jay-Z) and ""Drugs"". This is due to more tight flowing and less nasty lyrics. But the real flaw to this album is that 95% of what Kim says came from Biggie's catalogue. If you don't believe me, then check out Ready to Die or any song he made before then.
Overall, this ain't the classic that everybody says it is. There are times when Kim kicks a notable line, but those moments are few and far in between. And if she does kick a good line, nine times out of ten it came from Biggie. I would tell her better luck next time, but her second album is even worse.

Anne always delves deep into each ballad to make it shine as a special experience for her adoring fans; and this particular album has some of the most touching songs I've ever heard Anne sing. The quality of the sound on this CD is excellent and I like that artwork, too.

""What a Wonderful World"" opens the track set with Anne singing at her usual very best; her voice is strong, clear as a bell and just beautiful. Great! The arrangement makes good use of the strings and percussion; and it all holds its own very well. ""Put A Little Love in Your Heart"" shines brighter than silver and gold combined when Anne sings it; the piano arrangement is perfect and those backup singers harmonize faultlessly--not that Anne ever needed backup, but they do sound pretty good. ""You've Got a Friend"" is a most poignant ballad that gets the royal treatment from Anne; she sings this with all her heart and soul and just one listen proves it.

""Let It Be"" stuns me with its beauty; Anne does a great job singing this classic Beatles tune. ""Bridge over Troubled Water"" was always one of my favorite songs; and Anne does this with panache. Anne was born to sing musical numbers like this one; she's truly in her natural element here. ""I Can See Clearly Now"" has a lush arrangement overall and Anne delivers this without ever letting go of a single superfluous note! ""Amazing Grace"" is very moving and even elegant in Anne's capable hands; this is clearly a major highlight of this album.

Anne and Tommy West do a splendid medley of ""Just a Closer Walk with Thee"" and ""Take My Hand Lord Jesus;"" and listen for ""Softly and Tenderly"" which is absolutely perfect. ""How Great Thou Art"" has wonderful music but it never steals the show away from Anne, she sings and remains squarely front and center right where she belongs! ""Let There Be Love"" is gorgeous when Anne does this with Dawn Langstroth; and the album ends very nicely with Anne Murray performing ""In the Garden."" ""In The Garden"" is another moving piece and it rounds out the CD perfectly.

266,5.0,False,"01 26, 2004",A2CHLPRJZSD6U9,B000000OS8,Mr. S. St Thomas,"This, and three other XTC albums are my must-have, absolutely essential XTC works to own. Because of sheer diversity, focus and songwriting beauty. The other 3 are Black Sea, Oranges and Lemons, and Apple Venus Volume 1.
What is so beautiful about MUMMER is it's distance from other XTC works. And that what becomes the XTc sound here, crops up later in other releases. Mummer and what it does never truly left XTC, and both songwriters (Partridge & Moulding) changed their writing styles on this album and never looked back.
Many here have mentioned the troubled tour of English Settlement, and why XTC withdrew from the public arena, so I guess I'll try and encapsulate what makes this one of my favourite XTC albums . . .
For one, this album sounds pristine, whether its the remastered version, the vinyl or its original CD release. It is one of the best sounding XTC albums they released. Despite the loss of Terry Chambers (though he appears on a few tracks) replacement studio drummer Peter Phipps suits XTC to a T. His drumming, and the engineering on this album truly shine, no more so on 'Ladybird', one of the best songs Partridge has written to date. There is no possible way Chambers could have played 'Ladybird' in its style, and though he's a great drummer and suited XTC pre-Mummer, his loss was somewhat XTC's gain. A fuller pallette of rhythms is explored and used, and each suit every song. Phipps would have been a great replacement for the long haul.
Moulding changes the most on this album. His songwriting style that is present to this day, surfaces on Mummer. By Oranges & Lemons, Moulding was a completely different songwriter, and far better for it. The often maligned 'Wonderland' is the first of his songs to actually employ instrumentation that augments the lyric or tone of the song, and by Oranges & Lemons he became so good at it, that people stopped noticing how great a songwriter he is. Deliver Us From The Elements and In Loving Memory of a Name are probably two of his least known tracks, but by far two of his best, particularly 'In Loving . . . ' What is surprising, is the amount of material Moulding had available for inclusion on this album, that was every bit as good as what made it in the end. Two songs, 'Spare A Penny' and 'The World Is Full of Angry Young Men' should have been included with the CD release. (..Angry Young Men can be found on 'Rag & Bone Buffet', and BOTH versions of 'Spare A Penny' you'll just have to look around for -- its the reggae tinged 'Penny' that I think is such a strong song, but its message is probably what stopped Colin from going ahead with it)
Partridge is by no means a slouch on this album either. Song after song he just produces wonderful pieces of art. That he thought 'Great Fire' was single potential is possibly what stops this band from wider monetary success. It is a great song, but this album really is an 'album's album'. I can't really hear many singles coming from this, though a load were released from it, and videos exist for practically all of the songs (barring 'Me & The Wind', 'Great Fire', and 'Deliver Us From The Elements').
The three man XTC (Gregory / Moulding / Partridge) come off the touring-go-round and produced an incredibly peaceful, yet disturbing work. And I honestly have to give Andy Partridge some much deserved credit. 'Human Alchemy' will always remain for me, a song that just had to be. That a person of 'caucasian race' actually had the nerve and courage to say what he says in this song, will always garner my respect. Kudos Andy. Thank you for saying it, and meaning it. I wish there were more like you.
Again, not the first album for a 'newbie' to buy from XTC. In fact, I can't actually recommend that first album to get by them! You'll just have to take a chance on one of them, and see where it takes you. (If you're obsessive compulsive, please join the queue . . . )",Mummer,1075075200

Like your ordinary bands like Venom or Slayer, Deicide don't pretend to be associated with Satanism for attracted fans... they really are true Satanists who became members of the ''Church Of Satan'' which I found quite unique and got into their history. Let's get to the album okay, it has manic guitar leads, voices sounding like Glen is demonically possessed, and heavily satanic lyrics to date. The best songs to me are ''lunatic of God's creation'',''dead by dawn'', ''day of darkness'', ''crucification'' which is scary to listen to and maybe ''mephistopheles'' which is the name of a evil spirit who Faust sold his soul to the in the German legend.

If I had to rate each disc i would give 5 stars to disc 1 and 4 to disc 2, cuz in disc one there is more originality in production and in the rap itself than in disc two. My personal top ten songs from both discs are the following (in order):
1. Only God Can Judge Me (Disc 1): Absolutely GREAT song, which majes it the best one from all the others in both cds! Great lyrics about how people judge Tupac and his homies badly and the sadness occuring in the ghetto streets. Plus an awsome beat and synths which blend it with funk as well. JUST GREAT!!!
2. I Ain't Mad At Cha (Disc 1): Another lyrically astonishing song, which got a great slow beat mixed with piano notes which flow perfectly with 2pac's raps.
3. No More Pain (Disc 1): It's one of my very personal favourite. production is EXCELLENT, JUST EXCELLENT, can't be better, thanks to DeVante! 2pac's unleashes all his anger in his menacing lyrics during all the song!! One to check Out foe sure!!

The title is ironic because on this album they achieve a more ""balanced"" and appealing sound as a band than on any prior album. In particular the proper balance between Mike Pinder and Justin Hayward is finally struck. Mike's electronics are more diversified, playful and subtle, and Justin creates a wider range of sonic expression on electric guitar than in prior efforts.
Three songs stand out as first rate. ""It's Up to You"" by Justin is the best on the album, and one of my favorite Moodies' songs of all time. It is loose, energetic rock 'n roll, and I remember a rock guitarist commenting what fun it is to play leads like Justin's on this song.  Notice also, his gentle power chords during the ""we have got nothing to lose"" section - brilliant!  ""How is It We are Here"" is my favorite of all Mike Pinder's songs, thanks to the snappy beat of John Lodge's bass, Mike's brilliant use of electronic keyboards and Justin's guitar solo that seems to throw off fireworks. ""Dawning is the Day"" by Justin is also nice and tight.  There is an extended alternating of tonic-dominant chords just before the final section of repeating ""Listen we think we have found you"", during which Graeme, the ever-subtle and unobtrusive drummer, punctuates Justin's strums with off-beat wiggles of percussion that make you feel something is about to be born.  Graeme can do that to you, even if you are not paying attention to him.
Most of the other songs are enjoyable, if unexceptional, and it is pleasing to see Graeme, the shyest writer of the group, score with ""Don't You Feel Small?"" The original hit single of ""Question"" included a knock-out fast acoustic guitar introduction by Justin that in the album version is overwhelmed by the bombastic ""TA-DA"" orchestral sound that ruins this segment of the otherwise good song. ""Melancholy Man"" includes a spectacular electronic keyboard instrumental section that climaxes with a descending cascade of notes like a shower of falling stars that alone makes this otherwise dull song by Mike well worth listening to. John's ""Tortoise and Hare"" tries a little too earnestly to be a hard rocker, but I enjoy it anyway.  ""Minstrel's Song"", John's other contribution is enjoyable only up to a point, and overstays its welcome.  Ray Thomas' two songs are overly sweet and I usually skip over them.

Yes, it has some good moments, but I don't think they *quite* found their songwriting style yet. Or actually, they DID find it, and used it very well on the Fly By Night album, but for this album the band members wanted to experiment with the progressive rock movement going on at the time, and on for the time being they didn't quite find a way to mix hard rock or pop rock with prog. That would soon change though with their next album.

I think my biggest problem with this album is how the pop songs aren't quite as memorable as they should be, and the prog rock songs aren't as involved and imaginative as they should be either. So basically the band must have been lacking the urge to write memorable songs or just concentrated too hard on the prog pieces, and weren't able to approach the pop songs (such as ""Lakeside Park"") the right way. It's still a good song though, but almost feels tired. A band that was still relatively new at this point in their career shouldn't feel tired, but that's the feeling I get when listening to it.

Despite that, ""Bastille Day"" is a GREAT rocker. I love that song. And there's some good moments in ""The Fountain of Lamneth"". I can really do without that one guitar riff repeating over and over though. It seems to appear more often than it should. Some of the more quiet singing moments are really emotional though. It's just that the whole piece doesn't flow as well as Rush would make them flow on subsequent releases.

Well Deff Leppard seemed to have that same effect with Hysteria and Adrenlize. But before that they were throwing down crazy hard rock like No, No, No, Me and My Wine, On Through the Night and the almost metal-like Answer to the Master. Then Pour Some Sugar On Me shows up and it seems all their songs are""for the ladies."" Again, if there is a better reason, don't bother, I don't want to hear it. The title track Hysteria, Animal, Love Bites, and Armegeddonet only added to it. But here comes the problem, Deff Leppard is notorious,even back then, actually especially back then for long breaks between albums. So after Hysteria we all wait patiently knowing the penchant for loooooong concert tours and the perfectionistic attitude of making sure everything is right. Well they fire back with Adrenalize with songs like Do Ya Wanna get Rocked, Have You Ever Needed Someone so Bad, and i think Kick Love Into Motion got some play, and the ladies swooned again. Now I ain't hatin but we waited all that time to get what literally sounded like the songs that didn't make Hysteria. I really like Deff Leppard, seriously, but that was BS.

So Slang comes out and as far as I am concerned, makes up for everything. As important as Hysteria was to the band's success and as great as it still is to this day, Slang is what we were headed for before Hysteria and Adrenalize. A lot of people claim this was DefLep trying for grunge, but I hear no grunge thank the rock gods. They self admittingly were trying to do some new things and see if their fans would allow them the same creative flexability as the fans of bands like U2 and Chilli Peppers. No one gets mad when they do something different. But hard rock fans tend to want their bands to just stick with what got them there and never change. I have seen only 1 hard rock band actually pull that off over an entire career and still be as strong today as they were when they started. ACDC stuck to the same recipe album after album after album. Problem is very few bands can pull of the things ACDC can.

Slang brings the rock in a lot of different ways but it is unmistakable rock. It is dark, not metal, but ballsy all the same. All bands will eventually grow artistically as there success does but most will eventually come back to a sound much like they did when they initially won over all their fans. But Slang was not as much reaching out as it was coming back around. It didn't sell well so the band since then has strived for more Hysteria type material. Unfortunate, can't be too mad though, the chicks dig it.

I recently saw them in concert, it was good to see they still got it, the concert was great. Their showmanship and live ability is still top notch. Its good to see bands from this era showing new bands how it is done as well as the grunge bands that made them so unpopular for a while and are still trying to figure out how its done.

After absorbing Sonny Stitt's logical, fluent, cohesive, structured, text-book solos delivered with as ""embodied"" a sound as any saxophonist could hope for, I initially experienced some disappointment upon hearing Pepper's more exploratory, fragmented melodic lines.  Then I heard him go head to head with Stitt (""The Hollywood Sessions""), and he not only comes close to matching Sonny's technical proficiency but adds a hint of the unpredictable, of genuine risk-taking, that brings a dimension not present in the playing of Stitt, the music's ""most perfect saxophonist.""

The unmistakable emotion, even passion, that emerges in Pepper's later playing is not as evident on this more conservative 1950s recording.  Still, even here Pepper manages to escape the stereotypical ""cool"" sound with which the West Coast scene was identified, playing with a warmer feel and less detachment and deliberativeness than his Coastal contemporary, Lee Konitz.

The kit comes with almost everything you need, the missing part based on which phone you have.  My Sprint Samsung Epic was good to go, but iPhone owners and any others with a phone that doesn't use a standard mini/micro USB connector will have to bring their own charging cable.  The mount is sturdy and allows the cradle to detach so you can store it away when not in use.  The cradle itself holds my phone nice and tightly, with no worries of it falling out and hitting the floor while driving.  The mic on a string design leaves something to be desired, and could potentially be an easy point of failure, (mount loses its grip and falls, retractor breaks, object gets snagged on the cable, etc).

It's advertised as working with any smartphone, but the manual clearly states that if it doesn't work with your phone that you should check the compatibility list. On my phone though everything went fine, Pairing it with my phone and syncing the contacts was no problem.  Using the voice commands to make calls was hit and miss, requiring some retraining of the Minikit to get it to work more consistently.  The little green and red LED lights that denote which button is which don't stay on while the unit is powered on, which can make hitting the right button and knowing if it is on or off confusing.  I found myself just leaving it plugged in and on all the time, not relying on the battery power whatsoever.

Finding a spot in my minivan to install the Minikit that was within reach, did not break the law, and was convenient for GPS use took a little time, but I eventually found one.  The mic was installed along the top of the instrument cluster, directly in front of the driver's seat.  According to the User's Guide, this was the ideal area.  During road trials, I found it a bit difficult to hear the Minikit at highway speeds (windows rolled up, no music, no fan blowing), but around town it was just fine.  As an alternate, I may try plugging my phone's audio into the car stereo and see how that goes.  Results from the people I was calling were hit and miss, some saying that they could hear me fine, which others I had to shout at.

When it's all said and done, I am not sure the Parrot Minikit Smart was the best option, compared with Parrot's integrated products that can be had in the same price range (CK3100, CK3000, and CK3200).  It does fulfill a need though, and works well enough.  Using with my phone for charging and navigation is a sure plus, and would be more so if it were louder.

You will first see the ""CON"" followed by my ""RESPONSE"".  I have made no changes in their negative reviews.  They are quoted exactly as posted by them.  Furthermore, I am not a tech, just an informed novice.  I tried to address all of the 1 and 2 stars and some of the 3 stars.  First, start with the online tutorial.

CON:  The back buton is on the top left hand corner.
As a right hander , each time I press the back button , my thumb needs to travel all the way to the top left corner and the button is not with-in reach , inspite of my big palm.
This is putting lot of pressure on my thumb.
If you are really interested to buy this phone , please check the ergonomics before you do so.

RESPONSE:  This is absurd.  This reviewer can't even spell.  Most of us are right handed.  However, I hold my LG in my left hand and simply move my thumb to the top left corner and unlock it.  It is very easy.

CON:  The Dare is slow, it's touch screen is oversensitive you have to correct the . mark because you wanted an n but it keeps giving you a period mark. Give it some time and you to will be back to texting the old way instead of using the full keyboard.

RESPONSE:  I have not found the Dare to the least bit slow and my previous phone was the LG VENUS a similar phone.  I had some learning curve problems with the touch screen and went into Verizon where the tech quickly showed my how to use it correctly and I have had no touch screen problems since then.  First of all I can't believe people still text message when Jot.com is available.  But, if you do, I find the full keyboard very easy to use and user friendly.  I am 6'1"" and have big hands and it is still not an issue.  It was like moving from a stick shift car to an automatic, just a little learning curve.

CON:  unresponsive touch screen freeze ups and lock ups battery overheating phone would place calls on its own even when the screen was locked with that being said the lock feature was sketchy......

RESPONSE:  I have never had this problem and never heard of anyone else having the problem.  If I would have had the problem, I would have simply had Verizon replace it with a new one.

CON:  this phone has a terrible screen. You can not read anything when outside or in direct sun. The connection ports are not well designed eitgher and you have to take the cover off everytime yo want to simply use your car charger.

RESPONSE:  If this is an issue for you, for less than $5 you can buy a screen protector and it does away with the glare without loosing any of the screen's resolution.

CON:  I bought it mainly for the 3.2 megapixel camera. That has been a major disappointment, mainly because it is so difficult to transfer photos to my computer. Verizon and some other companies make it difficult to transfer photos directly to your computer because they want you to use the avenues they have set up for you, such as emailing the photos, for which there is a charge. I have had to buy a Micro SanDisk chip for about [...]......  The location of the two buttons that turn the DARE on are located on the lower right of the front and on the upper left side, locations that result in the phone being turned on accidentally very frequently, and draining my battery......

RESPONSE:  Absurd.  I love the 3.2 megapixel camera and I simply took the Micro Disk from my previous phone and plugged into the Dare.  And, of course, there is a charge for texting photos.  Is it supposed to be free?  Texting is not a free service.  And, for $[...] at Best Buy you can buy a Micro Disk which I previously purchased for my LG VENUS.  I have no problems transferring photos from my phone to my computer.  If you really have justified issues, have Verizon replace the phone.  Further, I find the placement of the lock/unlock buttons excellent.  You also do not need to use the touch screen feature if you find it inconvenient.  Simply push the unlock button twice.  I have never had it unlock in my pocket.  It seems to me it is fool proof.

CON:  Reception sucks. No one is experiencing this, so I guess it's my location.

RESPONSE:  I think the above person probably answered their main CON.  I have never had a reception problem.

CON:  when i compare the scroll and touch features to the ipod touch i have....

RESPONSE:  The DARE also does not cost [...] or [...].  Would you expect an apple to compare to an orange?

- Case is great quality and construction.  Whatever material they used is a good balance between grip and smoothness.

No padding, but I prefer that since it's less bulky.  I think the only improvement is to have the case interlock with both ends better.
- Holster is very functional, but poor for durability (see below).  Flipping the lock to pull the phone out is easy and seating it is easy as well.

You buy a $1000 + camera, and put a chintzy looking plastic thing on it.  It gets scratched up, and makes it harder to see through it, and if you bump your camera just right, it's gone.  These glass protectors improve on all of these shortcomings:
1. First, they are extremely easy to install, unlike the plastic film protectors, they are easy to line up, and you get no bubbles.
2.  Your camera is manufactured with a glass protector that protects your actual LCD screen.  The film or hard plastic cover usuallly seen on cameras are actually protecting the factory LCD protector from being scratched. These GGS glass protectors look just like the factory one, except it says GGS and your camera name at the bottom instead of just your camera name.  The factory glass on my top screen was cracked, so I ordered a genuine Nikon part and replaced it.  When I installed the GGS protector over this, I couldn't tell them apart, so if your top screen glass is cracked, I'm pretty sure you could install this one instead of the Nikon part.  Unless you knew these were screen protectors, you woudn't even know they were installed.  They integrate that seemlessly with the factory look of the camera.
3. I have had one of these on my P7000 for over a year, and it still looks like new.  Not a scratch on it. Optically, they are completely transparent, so you won't even notice they are there either.

They also make these for Iphones, so I think I'm going to stop getting the stupid film that lasts a month if I'm lucky, and get the glass for our phones too.

Los contras:
1. La pantalla horizontal: cuando quiero escribir en la pantalla horizontal muchas veces tarda mas de lo que quisiera para que el telefono entienda que gire la pantalla.. y muchas veces el telefono ni sabe, asi que tengo que darle unas sacudidas para que entienda.

2. La batera, aunque dicen que poda durar como 4 das, la ma, al final del da, ya tiene 2 o 3 rayitas. Y es uqe el telefono pasa buscando como conectarse a internet, asi que hay que desactivar el escaneo wi-fi automatico, activar una opcion que dice algo de widgets en modo desconectado, desactivar el bluetooth, y no jugar mucho.. tal vez asi dure 2 dias.

It is another album in the dance/club music vein, though it is a darker and much more cynical collection than ""Believe.""  Cher pulls it off beautifully though.

Right before this album came out, 9/11 happened.  Cher dedicates the tribute song ""A Song For the Lonely"" to the ""Courageous People of New York"" who endured through the horrible event. When I last saw her in concert (Farewell Tour, 2005, Glendale AZ) and this video was shown in the ampitheater, I was struck by the WTC symbolism and how moving the song was.  This CD has a link to the video and it is definitely worth watching.

I think ""Believe"" was a much-more commercially viable disc than ""Living Proof,"" though I think that ""Living Proof"" is a more powerful recording. It also took me a few listenings for me to really start to like it.  It's packed with great songs.  I always thought that Diane Warren's ""Body to Body, Heart to Heart"" should have been released as a single.

The record company antics of releasing different versions of the disc in the U.S. and Europe are a bit tiresome: the European versions contained additional songs and short-changed U.S. fans.  The same company did the same thing with the ""It's A Man's World"" disc in the mid-90s.

Ill say here and now, with no hesitation or reservation, that Eminem is easily the best rapper Ive ever heard. No popular rapper you can think of, alive or dead, even comes close. I mightve been saying the same about guest Royce Da 5-9 if he weren't upstaged by a rapper whose comedic wit, clever wordplay and sheer rhyme skills near genius.

There is very little filler in Eminems verses. Even when hes lacing them with unnecessary profanities; the Slim Shady persona is a deviant (white-trash) druggie who aims to offend; almost every two bars are a quality set and many of those sets are classic quotables. Unless hes cheating it somehow, his creativity is close to amazing. He even does his own sound effects. The beats are also impressive, so the albums only major drawbacks fall on faulty choruses and silly skits.

I won't waste time telling you which songs were my favorites, for you are not me.  I will tell you, however, that you are in for a treat.  Rob Thomas, Sheryl Crow, and Bonnie Rait show themselves for harmony duets, blending their voices well with Willie's.  Lee Ann Womack, Kid Rock, and Brian McKnight go for the full-fledged thing--bringing to life tales of gunslingers, lost loves, and hope.  Willie redoes the old Kenny Rogers rock'n'roll song ""Just Dropped In..."" and goes entirely country on the title track and ""This Face,"" a wonderful ballad about aging.  ""Maria,"" ""Last Stand,"" ""Be There For You,"" and ""Time After Time"" keep the album's upbeat going, while ""Mendocino County Line"", ""Won't Catch Me Crying,"" ""Don't Fade Away,"" ""Recollection Phoenix"", and ""You Remain"" provide a gentler, quieter side.

The way I look at most of Alice Coopers releases from the early to mid 1980's is the same way I look at Iggy Pop's work form the same time period. None of it is really horrible (at least not completely) but none of it is really great. They both seem to have like the whole new wave thing and wanted to join in on it. It didn't work out well for either of them. But what blows my mind is they were maybe the two most original front men in the history of rock n' roll and yet they wanted to do something...bad..? because lets be honest they must have been the only ones who thought the genre was going to last because once it stopped they both kept making new wave music.

'Zorro's Ascent' 'No Baloney Homosapiens' 'I Like Girls' and 'Tag, Your It' are all decent rock tracks. They have typical Cooper charm in the lyrics. Especially 'No Baloney...' but none of them are worthy of the Alice Cooper name. Though 'Remarkably Insencire' is a real gem.

The rest of the album feels trite and boring, not to mention that Cooper sounds like he is bored with the music. The production for one thing is horrendous.

We have a 5.1 speaker system, controlled by one speaker volume knob (no remote control). It's wired from the TV to a 1/8"" Y/duplex plug; one line continues to the speakers, the other goes to the headphones. Turn the speakers down all the way, and you only hear it through the headphones. Ok so far.

But, guess what happens when you have the speakers up halfway, with the headphones plugged in, and you change the volume on the headphone using the KOSS Volume Control? The volume of the external speakers changes! Huh? How is that possible? It was odd at first, but if you lowered the KOSS unit's volume, the speaker's volume went up. Raise the KOSS volume, the speaker's volume went down. It's something to do with the amount of signal strength going to the headphones that sucks it from the 5.1 speakers. I had to add a label ""Loud"" and ""Soft"", mounted just the opposite of the Low-to-High volume legend near the control wheel, since it controlled the speakers opposite of what you'd think.

So the KOSS Volume Control can function as a wired speaker volume control as well, provided that headphones are wired in parallel to the speakers. Who knew?

p.s. I like it so much, I'm buying another.",Another interesting use: external speaker volume control,1345075200
466,5.0,False,"05 15, 2004",A1OVSKQCT56NTT,B00004SD89,Spiff,"These are great, great headphones, at bargain price. I've used them mostly with a NAD C340 amplifier but also did some listening with cheap portable players. They are extremely comfortable, which is always a plus if you plan to listen for a long time. The structure looks good, very lightweight, but I still think some of the plastics used look too cheap, I guess build quality in general looks cheap, the glue under the Sennheiser rubber strip on the top, etc. Maybe Sennheiser decided to focus the cost on the transducers, because they sound a lot better than they look.
Even so, not all that fragile, design is very effective, the headband is large and adjustable, the soft cloth pads are very pleasant. Overall, these headphones are EXTREMELY comfortable, probably the most comfortable headphones I have ever tried. The longevity of the HD590 is assured since all vital components can be replaced when damaged. The OFC cable has the usual detachable mini-jack (one wire only, attaches to left transducer) always useful if you keep tripping on the cable or need an extension. The velour pads are also easy to remove (which is good since they seem to pick up dust like a vacuum cleaner). Also, keep in mind that they are very permeable to ambient noise because of the open design. If you plan to use them in noisy environments, that might be a problem.
When it comes to sound, some people think the treble is inexplicably sharp and intrusive, probably making these more adequate for jazz and classical. They are indeed very bright, but I don't find them fatiguing or excessively harsh. True, these excel in detail with classical and all acoustic, but also sound pretty decent with completely different sounds from Rage Against the Machine to Bauhaus. Very high resolution, with natural bass, not too punchy, but enough to please most listeners.
Yes it is true, the Sennheiser HD 600 are also amazing headphones, a lot darker than these, but still great. There is a catch however, at 300 ohms the 600 need lots of juice, definitely not easy to drive with maximum quality unless you have a dedicated headphone amp or a very good integrated amp. The 590 don't need a dedicated amp, at only 120 ohms nominal impedance, they are easy to drive, even from laptops, portables and other low output sources. When it comes to sound quality, there's really nothing like picking a few models and listening before choosing (to the right CDs). Your opinion might be completely different. To me, while not perfect, these are definitely in my list of favourite non-electrostatic headphones. I also own the pricier Sony MDR-CD3000 (a fairly high-end model often considered superior to such beasts as the Grado RS-1, the HD 600/650 and the AKG K1000) and comparing the two I can say that at about 33% of the 3000's price, the 590 sound very, very good. Ok, so not as good as the 3K, but still great value for money in the market of circum-aural open headphones.",Quite good for the price,1084579200

The idea was to put this in my car because I drive around a lot on the interstate and sometimes music just gets boring when you drive as much as I do.  I realize the antenna that comes with these is nothing to brag about, but I've picked up basically nothing but static from nearby transmissions by the time I squelch out the alternator whine in my car.  Maybe the truckers around here are just shy... The weather stations work fine, however.  I'm not going to give it an absolutely horrible rating because hey, it's a handheld CB.  They aren't exactly known for being awesome.  But for this price and brand name, I guess I expected a little better.  Maybe I just have bad luck with CBs, because I used to have an ancient hand-me-down Midland mounted in my truck with an 8 foot antenna and it didn't quite live up to my expectations either.

A cowboy workman fitted them before we moved in, and the set-up that's left has a talent for burning out fitted lighting in this one spot for some reason.  We tried replacing it ourselves, which worked, but not for long; three times now, it's burned out, and we've just lost patience.

As an alternative, we decided to try this, though we weren't too optimistic that it'd do the job we wanted.  Turns out, we were completely wrong about that!  This light easily illuminates the whole area left dark by the deceased ceiling light.  It lights it more cheaply too, not to mention more brightly and more consistently than the actual full light did, and all the time spectacularly NOT burning out at all.  It took us all of ten minutes to fit it, and since then it's been used every day, often running for hours at a time while we're working in there.

Boy was I in for a shock! This was the most disgusting cinnamon tea I have personally ever had! I'm not one to easily say a product is disgusting, but this one unfortunately was for me and here's why:

*ALMOND EXTRACT*

Please do not put almond extract in tea! It was so strong in this tea, you could not only smell the almond extract, but the taste was terrible and overpowering.

It tasted like someone had opened up a bottle of almond extract and put at least a teaspoon or more in the tea.

I think this tea would have been near perfect, if it wasn't for the overpowering and artificial taste of the almond extract.

Price: .$2 (@Whole Foods with coupons)

Caff-O-Meter: 0mg (Herbal tea)

Ingredients:
Hibiscus, roasted barley, roasted chicory, rosehips, chamomile, natural plum and cinnamon flavors with other natural flavors, ginger, roasted carob and cardamom.

-Smell (4.5) - The smell of this really does take me back, it reminds me of the cinnamon candies we would have at my grandmother's house when we'd go visit for Christmas. That being said cinnamon is the smell this is giving off more than anything. The scent is not overly powerful to where you'd think its fake though.

-Taste

+Unsweetened:
++Hot (2.5) - The taste is a little on the weak side. I'm not a regular consumer of plums so I can't say if that is what I taste but the flavor is certainly not off putting were it stronger this would be a 3 - 3.5. I do taste the hibiscus in there but that just may be a leftover of my Jamaica(great for lowering blood pressure) kick I was on before the autumn and fall teas came out.
++Iced (3) - The taste is still weak here but the flavor is a little more complex to me when chilled
*I prefer my teas Iced and 1 cup to .5 packet of sweetener. So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average.

-Sweetened ( For some reason most of the time until I add sweetener (1/2 pkg of truvia) I typically don't detect any of the flavors beyond just plain tea. It seems to always make flavors stick out.
++Hot (3)- The sweetener really makes the hibiscus come out, now the hibiscus is almost overpowering to me in this cup over everything else
++Iced (3) - Still tastes weak to me but making it cold toned down the hibiscus
2nd Steep (2.5) - strong cinnamon flavor, almost no color, don't think you're going to get much more than 2 steeps out of this. I would keep it in with a new bag though t get as much out of the bag as you can

Summary - So far it has been my experience the Celestial Seasonings holiday teas if anything shine in the scent department. The flavors do come out as weak but good. I would recommend doubling the strength of this but that is just me. So long as I can get the great deal I got on it I will keep it in my rotation until the holidays are over.",Celestial Seasonings - Sugar Plum Spice,1352851200

How on earth do you choose a box fan? Well really they mostly choose us don't they, we choose the first box we see. The product descriptions aren't much help, they mostly all say they are quiet, powerful, low cost to operate, etc. Are they really all that different from each other?

When looking for a replacement fan I found 2 of our fans were recalled in 2005 for fire hazard, so now I am replacing 3 fans. I guess in-plug mini-fuses became universal for a reason. Let's get started...

The 20"" box fans we'll compare are:
A - Aerospeed BX100
B - Holmes HBF2002A
C - Kenmore 32002
D - Lasko 3720
E - Lasko 3721
F - Lasko 3723
G - Lasko 3733
H - Lasko B20201

DESIGN AND DETAILS:
---------------------

All have white fans and grills, gray enclosures, 245-260 square inch areas the blades pass through, and 70""-73"" cords.

A - Aerospeed BX100
- Wavy grill (BX200/BX400 have other grills).
- Fan speed dial is on TOP.
- Little smaller enclosure (you wouldn't notice unless side-by-side), though the blades pass through an area near to the highest square inches of the bunch.
- The in-plug mini-fuse is easily replaceable if it blows.

B - Holmes HBF2002A (Target)
- Simple grid grill, blades have circle connecting them.
- Fan speed dial and plug connection are on the MIDDLE OF THE BACK. This is not ideal if bringing air into the house from a window and not an attractive option when exhausting out.
- The in-plug mini-fuse is easily replaceable if it blows.
- Looks exactly like the Kenmore 32002.
- NEGATIVE: At top speed it vibrates like crazy, enough to move itself.

C - Kenmore 32002 (Sears/Kmart)
- Simple grid grill, blades have circle connecting them.
- Fan speed dial and plug connection are on the MIDDLE OF THE BACK. This is not ideal if bringing air into the house from a window and not an attractive option when exhausting out.
- The in-plug mini-fuse is easily replaceable if it blows.
- Looks exactly like Holmes HBF2002A.

D - Lasko 3720
- Circular grill, blue logo on the front, blue speed dial.
- Fan speed dial is on TOP.
- Lasko promotes this as their fan of choice to PUT IN A WINDOW because it is more RAIN RESISTANT (not weatherproof).
- All Lasko in-plug mini-fuses are not replaceable.
- This is a wider (4 3/4"") and thus fairly STABLE fan enclosure compared to some of their models.
- Should be mostly the same as 3721, except this has the blue logo.

E - Lasko 3721
- Circular grill, blue speed dial.
- Fan speed dial is on TOP.
- Lasko promotes this as their fan of choice to PUT IN A WINDOW because it is more RAIN RESISTANT (not weatherproof).
- All Lasko in-plug mini-fuses are not replaceable.
- This is a wider (4 3/4"") and thus fairly STABLE fan enclosure compared to some of their models.
- Should be mostly the same as 3720, except no blue logo.

F - Lasko 3723
- Circular grill, blue speed dial.
- Fan speed dial is on TOP.
- Although it physically LOOKS LIKE one, this is NOT one of the rain resistant ones like the 3270/3721 (larger size, blue dial, etc.).
- All Lasko in-plug mini-fuses are not replaceable.
- This is a wider (4 3/4"") and thus fairly STABLE fan enclosure compared to some of their models.
- LOOKS just like the 3721, larger enclosure and no blue logo.  But again not a rain resistant model.
- NEGATIVE: Rattles a little at all speeds

G - Lasko 3733
- Simple grid grill.
- Fan speed dial is on TOP.
- All Lasko in-plug mini-fuses are not replaceable.
- NEGATIVE: Shakes a lot at settings 2&3.
- NEGATIVE: Listeners thought the hum tone was more annoying than the others.

H - Lasko B20201
- Simple grid grill.
- Fan speed dial is on TOP.
- All Lasko in-plug mini-fuses are not replaceable.
- NEGATIVE: LOUD at highest setting, listeners thought annoyingly so.
- NEGATIVE: Little more of an airplane hum/whine sound.

""(yelling over a fan) THEY SAY THEY ARE ALL QUIET!""
aka NOISE:
-----------

First some things that may help you get more out of this section on noise..

- It takes +10dBA to be perceived as a doubling in LOUDNESS.
- It takes just under +6dBA (5.85dBA) to be perceived as 50% (half-again) LOUDER.
- It takes just over +3dBA (3.22dBA) to be perceived as 25% (quarter-again) LOUDER.

(Note: When you read that +3dBA roughly doubles ""sound pressure"" that's different than perceived loudness)

Most sounds 50dbA on up have more of a potential to annoy, for example when while trying to talk, and especially starting at 55dbA (highly subjective, but gives you an idea).

Okay, now onto the comparison..

SUBJECTIVELY listeners liked the WHOOSH of air sound much more than that of the HUM of a rotating object. I noted next to the fan descriptions above which ones listeners felt had a sound they didn't like as much, regardless of loudness.

POWER USAGE:
--------------

We see below that the difference in yearly electrical cost is fairly small, and of course much less than air conditioning. If a little additional on-going expense for a fan makes this much less costly alternative to air conditioning more palatable, then that's probably a good investment.

However, being green is an important factor for some folks, so here below is a comparison in electricity usage I measured.

AIR VELOCITY:
--------------

The 5' and 10' were measured straight ahead from fans. The fan surface measurement was done roughly 1/2 way up the fan blades right against the grill.

On fan surface air velocity half-way up a blade at one point is, of course, just a sample point, and air velocity at a distance can be greatly affected by the degree of focus/dispersal.  Nevertheless, I hope this air velocity info helps us get a better sense for the differences between the fans.

SELECTING A FAN:
------------------

I removed these fans for excessive shaking, rattling, noise, and/or hum/whine: (B)Holmes,(F)3723,(G)3733,(H)B20201.

I then removed one fan for the center placement of dial and plug connection due to non-ideal position for window placement: (C)Kenmore.

This leaves these to choose from:
(A) Aerospeed BX100
(D) Lasko 3720
(E) Lasko 3721

Some other little Aerospeed BX100 (Fan A) comparative details:
- Option of lowest air velocity and noise would be of interest if someone will be very near.
- Replaceable in-plug fuse in case it blows, the Lasko ones aren't replaceable.
- Classic all-white front if you prefer that (like 3721 but not like 3720 with its blue logo).
- The option of a little quieter at the very low end of the loudness range.
- Lower electricity usage.

Lasko 3720 and 3721 (Fans D&E) for their part give the option of a little more air velocity at the very high end of the velocity range.

The Lasko 3720 and 3721 also look a bit different than the Aerospeed BX100, so looks may be another deciding factor for you.

Note that for any given loudness or air velocity they overlap in, these models have very similar sound/velocity profiles. That is, when comparing points where air velocities are roughly equal for the fans (at the same distances), the loudness difference is so small I can hardly tell which is louder and the numbers support that.

So there it is, my favorite three and some ways to compare them.

SUMMARY:
----------

In the end these are just classic 20"" box fans which are more similar than they are different. Hopefully whichever you choose won't be a lemon and will work for many years. Perhaps somewhere above you'll find information you can use to choose the best fan to meet your needs.

Whatever you get, if it rattles, shakes like crazy, makes an annoying hum, etc., try exchanging it for another, don't settle, there are less annoying fans out there and you'll be listening to them for many years to come.

I hope this helps someone :).

SHOPPING NOTE:
----------------

Millions of 20"" box fans are sold in the U.S. every year. Review sites cannot get anywhere near a statistically valid user sample, so although we learn from comments about DEFECTS and EARLY FAILURE, I suggest not filtering out a model based entirely on them.

There are also old reviews that have already been acted on by manufacturers to improve the product or fix a description, thus the review may no longer be accurate.

That said, defect and early failure comments with details are great for FEEDBACK TO THE MANUFACTURER (or author) and to help us all much more quickly SPOT SIMILAR ISSUES and thus get an exchange while it is quick and easy to do. Again though, I wouldn't use them to filter out a model entirely.","Comparison of Common 20"" Box Fans",1372982400

The grilling area is the perfect size for one burger, one chicken breast, two hash brown patties or two large sausage links at a time.  If you need to cook more, get a bigger grill.  I've even grilled two slices of Pepperidge Farm french toast and warmed vegtables wrapped in foil!!  It cooks thoroughly and quickly.  The center of the grill surface is hotter than the outer edges, but that hasn't been a problem.
The grill's small size makes it easy to pack on camping trips (because I hate dirty propane grills) or on vacation.  Just place a cello sponge between the grilling plates so the non-stick surface isn't damaged.
Speaking of non-stick...it's fantastic.  Just use the included spatula to gently scrape the cooking surface between burgers, and you'll have very little mess to clean up afterwards.
The grill takes about 3 minutes to heat up, and it cycles off/on to maintain a preset temperature.  The little indicator light stopped working after about 3 months, but that hasn't affected the grill's performance.

Even intermediate soldering skilled folks might have a challenge with this one.  However, as I was putting this together, I made lots of notes, since the directions for assembly are pretty much nonexistent.  So, without further ado, here was the order in which I put this project together.

1) Attach the switch (SW2) - The pins only let this be soldered to the board one way.
2) Attach the power input connector (J6) - Same as above.
3) Attach the 6-pin single row socket (J5) - This can be attached in either direction.
4) Attach the Oscillating Crystal (Y1) - Same as above.  I prefer to have the ""12.000"" facing me, but that's just my preference.
5) Attach the button (SW1) - Again, either direction is fine.
6) Attach the transistor IC.  (U2)
7) Attach the 28-pin IC socket. (U1)
8) Attach the diode.  (D1) - REMEMBER to have the silver band on the same side as the white line on the PCB for polarity!
9) Attach the (C1) and (C2) ceramic disc capacitors. - These have a little 22 on them.  They can be installed either direction.
10) Attach the (C3)(C4) & (C7) ceramic disc capacitors - These have 104 printed on them.  They can be installed either direction.
11) Attach the (C5) & (C6) electrolytic capacitors. - C6 is the bigger one.  HERE IS THE TRICKY PART....The board does NOT indicate which is the positive or negative.  The SQUARE shaped soldering pad is the POSITIVE one, so insert the components accordingly.  The longer lead on these kind of capacitors are the positive, and if you notice on the side of each, there is a marking for the negative side.
12) Here comes the fun part.....Time to attach the resistors.  Since the instructions do NOT indicate which resistors are of what resistance value, I wrote down how many of each according to band color, what resistance value they are, and where they go.
  R1-R8:  4-color band: 1.5k:  Brown-Green-Red-Gold
  R9:  4-color band: 120 :  Brown-Red-Brown-Gold
  R10: NOT used
  R11:  5-color band: 3.3M:  Orange-Orange-Black-Yellow-Brown
  R12:  5-color band:  Orange-Orange-Black-Brown-Brown
  R13-14: 5-color band:  Brown-Black-Black-Red-Brown
  R15-16: 4-color band:  Orange-White-Orange-Gold
  R17-18 are NOT used.
13) Attach the LCD display - BE CAREFUL to make sure the little ""dot"" next to each number is on the bottom...the side facing the resistors you just soldered in.

There are some other areas on the PCB that look like there's something that should go there, but for this kit, none of the others are used in the assembly process.  Ignore them for now.

Luckily, we also packed the Gorilla Tape. I used that next and they help up the whole weekend of me hiking through mud, dirt, stream and lots of rocks. A great tape that saved my camping trip experience.

2.) Around the houses, I use it to reinforce things like cardboard boxes I've overloaded or plastic bags that have been overloaded, I reinforce with Gorilla Tape...great hold. Easily holds up for years.

And sometimes I have fights with the tape -- it is either too thin, it sticks to itself when I unroll it, it has a mind of its own and wrinkles just as I am about to tape up the package, and if I should forget to create a little ""tape tab"" so I can easily unwind it from the roll the next time, I engage in the ""battle of the tape"" where I pick at it until I find a starting point, only to unravel pieces of the tape in an endless spiral -- what a waste of tape and money, eh?

So after receiving, trying and using this, I am VERY happy with this Scotch Super Strength Packaging Tape 3850-6. It is User Friendly!

I left a used roll of tape un-tabbed for a few days in a warm kitchen - the cut end of the tape was retrievable without tearing and without my losing any portion of the tape when I pulled it open.

UNLIKE some thicker plastic tape which will not conform to the shape of the package, THIS tape DOES - very willingly -- My packages are mailed out now knowing that parts of the tape will not decide to get stuck to something at the post office and pull off.

 First off at a mere 90ish pages I would not call it a novel.
 It also ends very abruptly with a link to purchase book 2 which seems more likely that it is the second half of what should have been the rest of this book.

 Annie and Neal ""had to"" get married. Actually when Annie got pregnant Neal would have rather she had an abortion. He never wanted ""Baby Natasha"" and is not all that fond of being a husband either at only 21 years old.

 Neal works a minimum wage job and resents that he had to leave school to support a baby he never wanted.
 I read a lot of horror and I never really expect it to make sense so I have no problem at all with this story line of a 5 month old baby being out to kill. What did bother me was a couple of things that the author seemed to presume, such as one character mentioning that a 5 month old baby can't even sit up yet. Sure they may topple over but babies can indeed sit up usually any time between 4-7 months.  While it may be unusual for a 5 month old to want to kill anyone I don't see why the author would find it unusual for a 5 month old to sit up. He also seems to presume that breast size has anything to do with milk production. Hence Annie's thoughts that she needed to supplement with formula because of not having large breasts. Most of all what really grated on my nerves was that a character (Annie) who is so paranoid of crib death and who is always reading books on baby care would ever in a million years leave her baby in a car alone in a parking lot. No I take that back, what bothered me the most was Annie's baby talk. It made me want to throat punch her.

 Other than that, it was not a bad story. I mean who doesn't love a good evil baby story? But somehow even though this is currently free at amazon I feel cheated, because I thought this was a complete ""novel"" and not just half.",I feel cheated,1463702400

Her boyfriend, Robert, is always there to offer comfort, but April cannot understand the changes in her body--the incredible heightening of her senses, her strength and speed. Her lust for meat.

Then one day walking along the campus between classes, she is rendered unconscious. Waking in the forest, she sees a face exactly like her own. April's twin sister tells her the truth. She is a hybrid. Her father was an alien shifter, her mother human. While April was given up at birth for adoption, Arquet, her sister, was raised with other hybrid clans in the forest. None of them trust humans.

The Rogue Militia is dedicated to wiping out the hybrids and April must fight for survival with the rest of her clan. Will she ever be able to go back to her life at the university and her sweet, loyal boyfriend, Robert?

Torn between her two natures, April longs for the serenity of her former life but she cannot stop the beast within her from emerging. She must learn to kill to save those she loves, but the enemy will not end the slaughtering of hybrids. The unarmed hybrids are pitted against warriors with modern weapons. It is April who must make the clans realize there are some humans who can be trusted--some who can help them in their battle for freedom.

Readers will love April. She is a worthy heroine caught in terrible circumstances who must stand up for the cause of justice. With one battle after another, the book is fast paced and full of action, but for me it was April's tender love and devotion which made this book an enjoyable read.",A Great Heroine,1277942400

Having not read the first book, I was just a little lost when I started reading the book but not enough that I didn't know what was going on... just felt like I should know more than I did.  I've never read a Maya Banks book before, but I know that her genre is EROTIC ROMANCE... and that's fine by me.  If this short story is anything to judge her by, Ms. Banks writes well and handles what could be a vulgar and off-putting lifestyle in an adult, sensuous, and honest way.  That ain't easy, so kudos on that.

The story is too short for a lot of character development, but I think the assumption is that all that's been done in the first full-length book so I don't fault the story for that.  Despite the brevity of the story, you do have a sense that these men are all different personalities and are each seeking something different from our heroine.

I am familiar with and purchase a decent bit of explicit romance and erotica.  I will say that I was a bit wary about a relationship with three brothers - there's pushing the boundaries and then there's crossing the line - but each ""couple"" (Holly and Adam, Holly and Ethan, and Holly and Ryan) has an independent but open relationship with the others.  And, though it may have been in the first book, it's not like they all drop trou and get it on together in this story.

What a story! Growing up I had been plagued by bad dreams and the bogyman and was very happy that they were not real. I am not sure what I would have done if the people and creatures of my dreams could become real. That's what happened here, they were extracted and collected in to live in a real museum, categorized by their type; nightmares, erotic, ect. Gruesome and suspenseful at times, without the porn show that many horrors can become, and at others seemed long winded. However Krisch was able to create a unique horror story the likes of which I have never heard before. Well developed characters that have extensive histories to create very complex beings, I would argue that there was too much going on with them, at times I found myself saying ""Just get on with it"". As they battle it out in the classic good against evil with several shades of gray mixed in for good measure. All in all The Nightmare Within was a success and I strongly believe that Krisch will only get better as his career continues.

It isn't because I can't think of anything to say, it's because I don't think I can do justice to Mr. Kewin's writing. This was a fairly short story, being only 19 pages (around 200 locations) long. However, Mr. Kerwin's lyrical writing style inspires vivid imagery of the scenes and characters.

In the opening scene we are introduced to the story's main character, a young girl named Kirsten Campbell. She is running through Grand Central Station with her twin brother when a new type of bomb is detonated, placing an impenetrable wall between herself and her twin. Those within become fish in a fishbowl, and the world watches on in horror as the results of the bomb detonation slowly unfold. We follow Kirsten throughout her life as she searches for answers, and a way to reunite with the brother trapped inside.

Normally those qualities in a bachelor have mothers trying to make a match with their young daughters; however, the mysterious death of his first wife makes the opposite true for Reign. Even eight years later the scandalous cloud seems to hover over him. Yet Reign has no intentions to seriously court any young lady again, so it does not bother him. That is, until a bow on a lovely lady's dress captures his interest.

Lady Sophia Northam has lived in a world of shadows since the age of six. That is when a blow to the head caused her to lose a considerable portion of her eyesight. Sophia normally avoids attending balls in London society. Yet when Reign whirls her onto the dance floor and then outside, she begins to fall in love. Problem is that Reign is the son of the man who murdered her parents and almost killed her. But when her older brothers are faced with possible financial ruin and Sophia learns they plan to marry her off, it is Reign that comes to her rescue.

***** FIVE STARS! This latest story by Alexandra Hawkins contains so much drama and intrigue that I hardly know where to begin describing my reactions to the book. Fans of the older titles by Laura Kinsale will especially enjoy this tale, as it seems to have the same sort of flavor. One main character (Reign) has a shady past that refuses to quietly fade away. The other main character (Sophia) is flawed, nearly blind. Both of their families share a volatile history. It all adds up to drama, drama, drama. The author also includes some plot twists and surprises, none of which I saw coming. An absolutely tantalizing read! *****

It does do some things right.  For example, the ingredients are great (you can see the list by viewing one of the product images of the back of the container; you may have to enlarge it), as is always the case with Juice Beauty.  It's good for sensitive skin, I found, as well -- I've had no ill effects from trying this out.

Please note that this contains willow bark extract; salicylic acid is a component of willow bark extract.  So proceed with caution if you are allergic to or sensitive to aspirin.  Also, it's best to use a sunscreen when also using hydroxy acids like salicylic acid.  (On the other hand, salicylic acid is great for me for clearing up breakouts so it may help in that regard.)  This product does not contain any SPF ingredients, although Juice Beauty does make a different moisturizer that might be good during the day.

This is fairly moisturizing, but the thing I really didn't like is that I couldn't get it to rub into my skin.  I applied it sparingly, as is my habit with moisturizers, but there was still white residue all over my face even after rubbing for a little while.  It didn't end up affecting my makeup a whole lot (which is good), but I'm really pale and this showed up and I think it would be even more obvious for people with darker skin.  If you plan to use this at night, it may not be a problem.

I did not notice any dramatic differences, but I really don't have a huge problem with fine lines to begin with -- I use antiaging products mostly as a preventive measure.  If you're looking for help with fine lines, the ""age defy"" serum from Juice Beauty is quite moisturizing and has (vegetarian) hyaluronic acid, and I'd probably recommend that instead.

From the backyard feeder to the world traveler observer, BWD has enough content in all areas to satisfy anyones particular interest, on any level.  There is even a regular section in each issue dedicated to back yard birding.  It isn't a magazine that is at all snobby and considers back yard novices peasants.  On the other hand, it is also a very technical and educational periodical for those that are advanced enough to actually take advantage of the many world wide travel suggestions and deals that are offered throughout the book. I first picked up some BWD back issues on Ebay and enjoyed it enough to order a regular subscription.  I was particularly impressed by its compact size, similar to Readers Digest.  It can be easily carried along in a purse or bag for traveling, and of course it makes a perfect addition to your bathroom library. The only caution that I would suggest to anyone that decides to buy a subscription is to pass on the offer of the digest newsletter that you can subscribe too for every other month that BWD isn't offered.  At $16 a for 6 issues it is not worth it at all.  Its a very thin, (about 10 pages) pamphlet style publication that has as many ads in it as helpful info.  Its a rip off in all honesty. I let my own subscription to it lapse after the first year.  You are much better off subscribing to the BWD email that is sent out periodically that is free, and loaded with article highlights and helpful info.

Gone are the wonderful articles on health by way of the PREVENTION of disease, replaced by advertisements for DRUGS and useless ""fashion magazine"" type stories that are filled to the brim with NOTHING of any value to the astute reader.

I noticed years ago that it started slipping in the value of information presented, but this is just a joke! I'd compare it to a print version of all those endless commercials on TV for perscription medications, showing young, hip people in positive situations, while a voice-over drones on with an endless list of side-effects including death.

Fun product pages offer seasonal comforts. For summer you may find yourself looking up beach blankets and fans. Special sections show you how to lose weight, even when on vacation. Interesting advice on how to beat stress and why you should find ways to increase the release of oxytocin.

""Oh, but I was one of their first subscribers!""...yeah, who cares?  After I really gave it some thought, I sure didn't care.  The fact that 6 of the last 8 issues were still wrapped in their plastic wrap further confirmed my lack of interest in this magazine.

I used to always snatch my boyfriend's copy of Men's Health when it would arrive in the mail and devour it before he got home from class.  So when Women's Health invited me to try out their first issue, I jumped at the chance.  I was happy that the magazines were very similar, but after awhile it seemed too repetitive.  Then Men's Health itself started changing into something boring and bland and my boyfriend chose to end his subscription.  Now, it seems like the same pattern is emerging with Women's Health.  It went strong for awhile, but now it just feels like they're regurgitating the same information over and over.

It's not so much that Women's Health is a *bad* magazine.  It is informative, it does have decent columns and helpful information.  But it's nothing special.  It doesn't contain any information that I can't find in other (cheaper) places.

In my late teens, I revisited the movie again when it ran on cable and I was able to copy it onto video tape. With my slightly better educated teenage mind, I finally ""got it"". I had come to the conclusion that Blade Runner was a cinematic masterpiece.

The film was perfectly cast (many of the actors were relatively unkown at the time), the special effects were amazing (even rivaling some of today's effects standards), the costumes, sets, and lighting were extraordinary, the music (by Vangelis) was gorgeous and the cinematography was breathtaking.

So, why only 2 stars?

First off, the DVD transfer is horrible. It's not much better than the VHS copy I have. I know that the film was digitally remastered and re-released in late 2006, but I simply refused to buy it again because of my second point:

This is the director's cut. Call me crazy, but I much prefer the original theatrical version. I LIKED Ford's voice-over narraration. It reminded me of the classic detective serials. Crossing that over to the sci-fi genre was a brilliant move in my opinion.

The director's cut actually took scenes OUT (with the exception of Deckard's dream which gave a totally new interpretation of whether or not he was a replicant). Usually, a director's cut is LONGER and includes MORE scenes. Why go to all of the trouble to re-release a film if you're going to make it shorter and take scenes out? This was especially hard for me to take when Deckard's dream sequence replaced the scene where he is half-drunk and plinking away on the piano and we hear an alternate version of the beautiful ""love theme"". To me, that was an amazing scene and for some reason, Ridley Scott felt that he had to change or eliminate it.

Thirdly, the DVD contains no extras to speak of.

Rumors have been floating around for years that a definitive ""final cut"" of Blade Runner was to be released on DVD with a lot of extras and bonus features, including the original theatrical version, the director's cut and the final cut of the film. Due to legal problems and disputes, this never materialized.

Luckily, I found this movie for $2.50 in the bargain bin at a local store. Otherwise, I would not have paid any real money to own this movie, which is a real shame.

This film is a classic and deserves MUCH better treatment. Hopefully, 2007 (Blade Runner's 25th birthday) will prove to be the year that this definitve edition comes to fruition. If and when it does, I will gladly shell out my hard-earned money to own it.

Like Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums, their follow-up films, Bottle Rocket is a wonderful mix of deranged humour and quiet sadness.  The drama always stops just short of heartbreaking, and the comedy just short of slapstick, leaving us only with a bunch of characters we care about, and their crazy, messed up lives.
Bottle Rocket is not flawless.  I'm not sure why not, just as I'm not entirely sure why its so close to flawless.

This is one of those twist-of-fate movies for playaz who manipulate relationships just to ""get some"" and move on.

The story is easy to follow.

There's tons of subtle but gutbustingly funny scenes.

The movie moves along at a great pace -- you won't go to sleep on this!

As one song pointed out, John Wayne did not fight on Iwo Jima, but watching his performance today you feel that perhaps he could have done. He was deservedly Oscar nominated for his portrayal of tough Marine Sergeant John M Stryker, but eventually lost out to Broderick Crawford. Tough sergeant John Strycker leads a troublesome group of new recruits into battle. John Wayne plays his usual stereotype tough guy but does what he does very well and like his men you do find yourself warming up to Strycker. Based on a true story, the infamous battle of Iwo Jima this has very good performances from the whole cast and good battle scenes but although they are often interwoven with actual newsreel footage I could easily discern every time the real scenes from the fictional ones, hence it loses one star. Perhaps it's the way actual Marines moved on the battlefield, or the load they carried, or how they took cover than no actor, however well taught, could imitate. But a film made so closely to the actual era is surely unbeatable in terms of authenticity regarding the faces, the attitudes, the material, the scenery and the language.

873,5.0,False,"06 9, 2005",A1SVXJZ3386U2D,0780021932,Randy Keehn,"I missed an opportunity to watch this movie several months ago.  When I had seen it listed on the upcoming schedule of a cable movie channel, I looked it up and it sounded like an outstanding movie.  It was several months before I had the opportunity to see it and, by that time, my expectations had sky-rocketed.  I knew that this was happening and I did my best to ignore this tendency but I was expecting to be on the edge of my seat constantly for slightly over 2 1/2 hours.  I wasn't but I did watch an excellent movie.

For me the strength of ""The Wages of Fear"" lies in its' portrayal of its' vagabond characters and its' analysis of courage (some might call it stupidity but I can't see spoiling a good thing with over-analysis).  The first half of the movie gives us a portrayal of the civilized vagabond in a third world country.  It's the best such portrayal I've seen since the opening portion of ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"".  These characters are losers for the most part.  They can't aford to leave their meager existance and there doesn't seem to be much point in staying.  There is a sense of superiority that these men emote but we're given to know that there doesn't seem to be much to back it up.

Eventually, there comes a real challenge due to an oil well fire at an American oil company site 300 KMs away.  Nitroglycerine is needed to put out the fire and drivers are needed to get it there.  The representatives from that oil company realize that the best people for the job are amongst these vagabonds.  Ultimately four of them are hired to drive two trucks loaded with the deadly cargo through a rough road in the wilderness.  The movie then displays how these four men handle the death-defying challenges that confront them.  Now is a real opportunity for these men to back up their bluster.  I felt one of the characters was over-done in his plumeting fall from tough guy to wimpering coward.  A more gradual metamorphisis would have been easier to believe and would have left a better impression.  As for the other three, we see the emergence of their strength of character that had previously been left to rot in the gutter.  The suspense of this journey is real but it is not an unending white-knuckle experience.  The ending disappointed me although I understand what the director, Henri-Georges Clouzot, was trying to say.

Some might argue that the movie was at least 35 minutes too long and I considered that point.  However, I enjoyed the whole movie from beginning to end so I tend to discount that.  I rather enjoyed the portrayal of the American oil company people.  It was as though there were the vagabonds, the third world inhabitants, and the Americans as three seperate class of people.

This is an excellent movie that does a brilliant job and saying what it is trying to say.  Some may over-rate the suspense but I'm not sure they can over-rate the movie.",Brother Can You Spare a Peso,1118275200
874,3.0,False,"03 31, 2015",ACJVGDN8G386P,078322687X,classicalsteve,"If there was ever a Hollywood-backed film personifying the anxiety of Generation X, it was ""The Breakfast Club"". If you were a teen in suburban America in the 1980's (as I was), this was your film, or at least it was supposed to be. The Boomers had ""The Graduate"" and ""Easy Rider"", the Silent Generation had ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and ""American Graffiti"". We have ""The Breakfast Club"". Or do we? Is it a cinematic masterpiece or overrated? Let's take a second look at this cult classic because as of this writing, the 30th anniversary of its release is coming up in 2015 with theatrical viewings scheduled around the country. Generation X'ers will be lining up to relive their teenage years.

While in his 30's, John Hughes had a brief directing career making films targeted to Generation X'ers. Hughes offerings were considered the fresh new voice speaking both to and from the point of view of Generation X, offspring of the sons and daughters of those who were children during and just after World War II, a.k.a the Silent and Baby Boom Generations. Hughes also directed ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", ""Sixteen Candles"", and ""Pretty in Pink"". Many of Hughes' films used the same talent. These youthful upstarts of our generation were fondly known as ""The Brat Pack"". (Some of the ""brat"" actors transitioned into adult careers while others fell off the radar.) Among Hughes' favorite talent were Molly Ringwold, Anthony Michael Hall, and Ally Sheedy, all present and accounted for in ""Breakfast Club"". By 1991, the Generation X'ers were becoming young adults, graduating from college and beginning careers and families. The voice of 80's teen angst was becoming pass. Hughes directed his last film in 1991, ""Curly Sue"", which paired a Boomer and a Millennial with disastrous results. It ultimately bombed at the box office.

So does ""Breakfast Club"" uphold today? Well sort of yes sort of no. There is no plot per se, only a setting. The setting is the high school library where five teenagers are being held in a day-long detention on a Saturday for wrong-doings which are never made completely clear. The real story is about each character and how they get to know one another. The film's strength is also its weakness, depending upon your point of view. Each student comes from a different aspect of the student body of the fictional high school. They are in essence, prototypes, maybe even stereotypes, of each of the different faces of the school. Molly Ringwold is from the ""popular"" and chic crowd of girls who wear makeup and nice clothes. Judd Nelson is the rule-breaker, who we imagine never does his homework and goofs off at the back of the classes he takes if he's not cutting school altogether. Even from the get-go, we predict that this is not Nelson's first time in detention. Emilio Estevez is the jock, probably a football player and wrestler. Ally Sheedy is the loser loner female, who at first grosses out Ringwold. Anthony Michael Hall plays ""the brain"", a kid who gets straight A's, especially in science classes, but who is otherwise not part of the ""popular"" crowd.

The idea is that these kids would never have even said hello to one another during a typical school day because they are all worlds apart. However, because they're in detention for various infractions, they are forced to meet and interact with one another. The main crux of the story is how the kids learn about each other and how they both fit and don't fit into their own stereotypes. They also begin engaging in behavior of their opposite counterparts, such as when Estevez smokes and does cart wheels on the upper floor of the library, similar to what Nelson's character usually does. This aspect of the film succeeds in spades. As a character study, it works very well. It could almost be a play.

Where the story lags slightly is in its lack of a storyline. When I first saw it, I had high-expectations because it was already becoming the ""must-see"" film for my generation. After viewing, I found I generally enjoyed it, but seeing kids simply talking and having some fun for 90 minutes is not exactly why I want to see a film. Near the end, is the famous ""dance scene"" where the characters let loose and let it all hang out. Hall being the brain is the DJ. Dance scenes like this were very popular with Generation X films of this sort, but now they seem rather dated. I want to see characters deal with and overcome dilemmas, not just talk about themselves and dance around. Of course the subtlety is to see the characters change slightly by interacting with kids they never otherwise would have. While I believe it's a nice beginning of an idea, I don't think it's enough to carry through an entire film.

""The Breakfast Club"" may be more important in terms of what it represents, the angst of Generation X, rather than it being a masterpiece of filmmaking and storytelling in its own right. The mark of a great film is when it speaks to later generations. I have seen ""The Graduate"", ""American Graffiti"", and ""Rebel Without a Cause"" many times, and they never seem dated, even though these were targeted to previous generations. Does ""The Breakfast Club"" do this for me? Not quite. It may have spoken more to me during that time, but it says less to me now. Maybe I wanted the cast to rip away the ridiculous sculpture in the middle of the library in the way that Dustin Hoffman steals away the bride at the end of the Graduate. Or for the kids to engage in something together, like the race at the end of American Graffiti. For all its honesty, even by the end of their detention, the Breakfast Clubbers were still in their own prison, the 1980's.",The Must-See Film for 80's Youth Is More a Character Study than a Story: Good But Not Great,1427760000

This movie takes place in 1985,which is genius showing the early punk years. That's why your not going to see any Green Day, Rancid, or The Casualties t-shirts or posters. But they do talk about the ""Sex Pistols"" and the ""Ramones"" The thing that caught the corner of my eye was that James Meredino decided to shoot this film in 2:35:1. Shouldn't it be in 1:85:1? But I guess that's James Merdino's style. For a movie which they only wasted eight hundred thousand dollars, it looks pretty damn good. It looks like they wasted more than eight hundred thousand dollars.
This film is about two punkers named ""Stevo and heroin Bob (Matthew Lillard and Michael Goorjian) who are college graduates who's dream is to make pure anarchy all over the country. Stevo's dad is a lawyer, who wants Stevo to go to Harvard Stevo has the grades, but he doesn't want to go with the system. After hardcore punk shows, and punch of drugs taken in, the two punks don't know what to do in Salt Lake. Heroin Bob doesn't really do heroin, infact he is scared of needles, that's why they call him that. What really caught my attention in this film is Til Schweiger  and how well he played his character mark. My favorite scene is when Mark explains how his whole family died, I know you will love that scene. Til Schweiger did that part so well it deserved an Oscar.  This film talks about the history of punk, and what a punker thinks.
This DVD includes audio commentary by Matthew Lillard, Michael Goorgian, and writer/director James Meredino. The commentary is really funny. What I noticed in it was the fact that they mentioned they took out some scenes, so where are all the deleted scenes? This DVD also includes the trailer for this film, and the movie ""go"". It also shows art stills from the original comic book. There's not a behind the scenes look, but I guess it's still cool. There is a lot of flash backs in this film, which when Stevo goes back into talking to the person you go, ""woo I forgot he was talking to that guy"". It is fantastic to see those effects.

She has a very workable imagination. Anybody can join in to work with her.(almost.) Well, let's get with the cast of this movie,now we have: Tom Cruise as Lestat, Brad Pitt as the remorseful vampire, Louis, Kirsten Dunst as the precocious Claudia and Antonio Banderas as Armand. The movie starts with a character played by Christian Slater, readying his tape recorder,beginning to interview a...vampire. The human-like creature turns to him,revealing himself to be..Louis, Brad's character. He begins to tell his story from his P.O.V. When he was human, he had a wife who died of childbirth, his baby boy or girl never made it either. So, he was already ready for death. That's when a vampire named Lestat decided to answer his prayers. The first time he taken his blood,he asked him,has he had enough. The second time he taken his blood, he told him, "" I'm going to give you the choice,I've never had."" Lestat gave him another life, ETERNAL LIFE. And for that,Louis sees the last sunrise for himself. I gotta admit, Brad's character has never looked so handsome and beautiful before. What a sexy-looking vampire! Anyway, the vampire saying went, ""In order to survive, you must feed!"" Louis couldn't bring himself to feed on the blood of humans,leading Lestat to do all the killing. Louis always fed on the blood of poodles, chickens and rats. Lestat found it funny for some reason. When push came to shove, they had their arguments and petty disagreements,talking about survival and being a killer vampire vs. morality. Lestat knew that Louis didn't like the way of survival, but he didn't care. While feeling stressed out, Louis found a little girl named Claudia, with her dead mother. He held her tight and sucked her blood. Lestat found them and started laughing and dancing with the dead corpse,celebrating the triumph of Louis's first taste of human blood. Louis was very depressed with himself and ran off to a sewer drain. Later on, Lestat found him, and told him he had a surprise for him. He took Louis back home and found Claudia, lying on the bed. Louis thought he killed her, but she was half-dead in vampire limbo. So, Lestat gives her a taste of his blood from his cut, she drinks until he shouted enough, and Claudia is transformed to the point of looking like a curly-haired doll with a savage bloodthirst to match. So, without giving the whole movie away, they tried living together, but, being that Lestat's rules were too much, they turned on him and ran, thinking he's dead. Together, Louis and Claudia searched the world for vampires just like them. And they did. First, they found a vampire named Santiago and then a leader named Armand. Armand welcomes them into his theatre and his underground Lair. Claudia doesn't trust Armand and his crew,but Louis says he has no choice but to stay where they are. Meanwhile,he was looking for a new mentor. I believe he found it in Armand, the oldest vampire he never met until that very moment. There's something else that's bugging Claudia, she needs a mother figure. After Louis feeds on the woman, believing himself a heartless vampire,Claudia kisses him. Spolier Alert: If you've never seen this movie and don't want the ending given away,then please read no further! Needless to say Armand's theartre troupe vampires including Santiago turn on Louis,Claudia, and for no real reason the woman 'cause they read their thoughts about they're incident between them and Lestat. So they wall up Louis to put him out of the way, and then they throw Claudia and the woman in a room where the sun comes through over-head. Sadly they both die ""burnt to a crisp"" with Louis unable to help them. So enraged about what had happened Louis seeks vengance by slicing up and burning those evil theatre troupe vampires. After that Louis not only decides that he was only going to get the worst end of the deal staying with Armand but also dubbed himself as ""self-sufficient. After that, he could deal with light, he seen Lestat for the last time,told the ending to Christian's character to publish and also told him that he doesn't want eternal life. When Christian's character drives off into the dawn, Lestat scares him by surprise and takes his blood. He drives the car, listens to the tape and says to him, ""I'm going to give you the choice,I never had.""

I finally deciphered how to do this and to save (record) my ""songs""--really just pre-set patterns with the tempo modified, and to name them so I can play any song I want by just selecting the song from my list. It may not be perfect, but it works for me and I'm not a technician, and don't really want a technician for live performances at small clubs and parties. I want a drummer and an unobtrusive bass player, and that is what I get with the Alesis SR 18. I can select the drum set I want and the type of bass, and can even transpose the key for the bass, but so far all I have done is select these as default settings so that all my songs use the same kit. It's fine for me and my limited use.

The sound, though, is much superior to the Zoom RT 223 I had been using. That machine has more patterns (over 400), but fewer usable ones, and some that were really annoying. The Alesis has just 100 patterns in the ""A"" list, and slight variations of those in the ""B"" list, and some fairly subtle fills that you can activate with the dual footswitch. These usually are in and out, meaning it will lead into a change (for instance into a bridge) and then out of that bridge and back into the main part of the song. I use them sparingly. Mostly I stick to start and stop once I've selected and modified the pattern for my song.

I know this is an anti-technical way to use this machine, but it works for me, and I suspect will work for others who don't want to spend all their music time programming a machine, but prefer to play with some reasonable accompaniment that is easy to access.

To sum up, it is a great sounding machine with immense technical possibilities, and it takes some effort to decipher the instructions, especially if you, like me, are interested mainly in an easy to use, good sounding drum and bass backup.","Great sound, not so easy to understand how to use",1453334400

The treble strings have been always unwounded to give a contrasting sweet lyrical sound in the trebles. This is the first set where all the strings are wound & the resulting sound is .... just okay
I thought the treble strings would be silver wound & be very bright so i thought it may be a good match for my lutheir built flamenco guitar. strangely the trebles are wound in plastic. The sound of these plastic trebles is somewhat like hearing the upper frets of the wound bass strings. For example, the 1st e strings sounds like holding the 14thfret on the D string.
I cant imagine them being suitable for any classical performance. Maybe for a flamenco sound or even a unique pop guitar tone. the sound is somewhere between nylon strings & steel. not as mellow as nylon & Not as bright as steel. It may work well with a dark sounding guitar if u want a different brighter,percussive snappy sound. However note that these strings are not extremely different from a general savarez high tension set. Just a little snappier but with lots of squeak cos of the wound trebles.
Here's my only complaint : the finger squeak is unbearable ! i cant imagine using it for a studio recording (no one can listen to every string squeaking)even if u have very clean technique.","not exactly groundbreaking difference in tone, its ok",1418774400

The amp simulations the Micro Cube provides are, well let's just say they're vaguely reminiscent of the amps they are trying to emulate.  The sounds still differ from one another enough to be useful, though, and this little box can pump out some serious (digital) distortion.  It's also fairly loud.  Like the Pignose and other small amps, you can also mic this amp and get some really suprising results.  Using the headphone jack as a line out will obviously yield pretty much the same result you're hearing through the speaker, as the sound is entirely digital.

Effects aren't too bad.  Trem is pretty good, reverb a notch behind, and I'd stay light on the Cube's flanger and chorus.  Forget the ""digital tuning fork"" - it's just a button that generates a tone to tune to.  Any kind of separate tuner is far more useful.

I've used more brands of valve oil than currently exists (many are out of business).  When I started playing, valve oil was just a thin oil in a little glass bottle with an eye-dropper cap on it.  They worked OK, if used daily and you kept your valves clean.  I remember more than one occasion over the years when I didn't oil my valves for some reason and a valve stuck during a concert.  I was a first chair player and usually had a bunch of solos.  Let me tell you, a stuck valve a the wrong time doesn't exactly make you sound like Harry James (Yes, he really was a famous trumpeter).  Recently, I suffered some stuck valves at a bad time and reviewed my habits.  Yes, I kept my valves scrupulously clean and oiled them DAILY.  No, it isn't the trumpet (It's a Bach Stradivarius),  Had to be the oil.  A friend told me about ALISYN.  I ordered a bottle and tried it.  I was a whole lot leery about a new oil because I thought I's tried 'em all.  I also can tell you that some valve oils smell so bad it's hard not to lose your lunch when you put the mouthpiece on your lips.  Well, ALISYN is a synthetic oil with no foul smell.  The BEST thing about it is, IT WORKS.  I am a good technical trumpeter and I play it all...classical, sacred, jazz, even country.  I need fast, reliable valve action.  I got just that.  Really fast valves, NO STICKING, no bad smell (or taste).  I also discovered that NOT oiling everyday will NOT cause the valves to stick.  I oiled the valves on my old cornet and put it up in the closet for a couple of months.  When I took it out to play, the valves still felt oiled and ready to go.  I don't think there is a better valve oil out there...and I've tried a bunch of 'em in my 63 years of playing.  I really like this stuff.  Wish I owned the company.

If you want a little more detail...

Paper trimmers usually have heavy wooden bases, probably so that they won't slide around during use.  But that extra weight means that you can't easily move the trimmer from room to room if you are working on a project.  By contrast, this Swingline ""Lite"" trimmer is probably about as light as it could possibly be and still remain functional.  It is very easy to carry around with one hand.

The base is a thin but sturdy plastic.  In addition to the four corner supports on the bottom of the base, there is a fifth support in the center of the bottom.  No doubt, this extra support is necessary on such a thin trimmer in order to keep it from sagging in the middle when holding your papers in place.

I am also pleased with the accurate cuts.  Some trimmers I've used seem to give me consistently crooked cuts.  Not so with this Swingline.  Whether I cut one or ten pieces of paper, I have never been disappointed by the cutting.

If I could gripe about one thing (maybe worth a half-star deduction), it would be this: I find that the safety latch for locking down the arm is a little tricky to access.  It's a bit ""tucked away"" under the arm itself, making it a little harder to lock and unlock.  However, because it's such a light trimmer, it's easy to pick up the entire trimmer with one hand and tilt it until I find the latch.

All in all, this is really a great trimmer.  Don't be put off by the ""Lite"" in its title.","Great trimmer, accurate cutting, despite being ""Lite""",1391644800

I've been trashing my softcovers more than usual lately, so I thought I'd give this reporter notebook a shot; I liked it so much I came to Amazon to reorder a few more after I filled up my first one. I love that the binding is on the top, so it's not in your way whether you're a rightie or a leftie, and the hardcover means this notebook is seriously holding up, whether I'm carrying it around in my pocket or jammed into some dark unfathomable corner of my backpack or whatever else. (I use small notepads like this to jot down ideas before I can forget them, so I have one on me pretty much all the time, even if I don't have a good place to carry it.)

I really like that it's got an elastic band to hold the cover shut... I like to write/draw in it with a set of Staedtler technical pens which come in a hard case, and I can keep my pad and pens together in my bag by slipping the pen case into the pad's elastic band. I'll probably stretch it out prematurely, but it's totally worth it. :D

As other reviewers have noted, this isn't really a notepad that you can flip the cover all the way over the back; doing so would probably break the binding or screw up your cover. So the product photos are a bit deceptive in that regard. But I haven't had any trouble with the cover constantly wanting to close on me while I'm writing or anything like that, and it works out great for me.

Pepper represents their middle period of counterculture Classic Rock music and may well be the top rock album of the entire 20th Century, (and of the 21st, so far!).

My favorite cut is ""With a Little Help from My Friends,"" a very melodic and period typical love-one-another tune. I was similarly bowled over by Joe Cocker's (slower) version of this composition which he sang live at Woodstock.

Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys, who was so impressed with Sgt. Pepper, tried with a Herculean effort to generate an album of this magnitude when, in response, he produced ""Pet Sounds"". It was good, but didn't come close to manifesting the brilliance of this Beatles masterpiece. (EDIT! Well, it turns out that this paragraph is erroneous! See ""comments"" on this review where someone much shrewder than I got it right -- still it SOUNDS good *.* )

Seward,"First I have to say that this is my first reel mower, so I have nothing to compare to, and my motivation for this purchase was not to be green, although it's nice to know I'm being green when using it. I bought this because the Tiffgreen sod supplier recommended cutting with a reel mower between 1/4"" and 1-1/4"" high.  Tiffgreen is a Bermuda hybrid creeping grass; so given the low cut setting and the fact this mower is specifically designed to cut Bermuda creeping grass and was the only one I could find in this price range, it was a no brainer.

I unpackaged, assembled the mower and grass catcher (sold separately), adjusted the cut height, and cut my 1300 sq ft lawn in less than 1 hour. So yeah, it's easy to assemble, adjust, and use.

In my opinion this mower and the grass catcher is exactly what I expected, given the price. The quality of the mower assembly itself seems very good, but I can see why others have complained about the handle being cheap (it could defiantly be better), but with care it should last several seasons (maybe longer), and seems like it would be simple enough to replace if and when required.
It's not exactly easy to push (it's a little like work), but it's not exactly hard either. It seems easy enough to maneuver, but will take a little time to get use to it and develop a system that is best for cutting my lawn. After a few cuts I'm sure I will be very efficient with it.

I did have to go over some areas twice, but I had to do that with my power rotary mower also. My lawn is completely bordered by brick and cement and it leaves about 4"" of uncut grass against all of the borders; so investing in a good trimmer is a must. And as other reviewers have stated, it will get hung up on debris in your yard, but it's not a big deal for me as I keep my grass short and clean.

I knew exactly what I was buying, so I was prepared to deal with all of the things I have discussed; again I was looking for a clean short cut and this does that, so for the price I'm happy.  If I had to replace it, I might decide to invest in a more expensive mower, but this one does exactly what I need for now.

I can see that this type of mower is not for everyone, if your lawn is overgrown, or has a lot of debris; then you don't want this type of mower. This is really for someone that is trying to keep their lawn looking like a golf course, so if that's you, look no further.",Exactly what I expected,1330473600

The pump is cheaper ounce for ounce, however the pump sprays heavily and imprecisely, which is why I ultimately returned to the aerosol can, even though it's less economical.  Somebody is going to argue that I'm failing to consider the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere, however my response to that is that the aerosol can has excellent, precisely controllable application characteristics, which is probably beside the point.  I first tried to buy this at REI, but they no longer carry the aerosol application version for politically correct ozone protection reasons, so I ultimate had to order it online from Amazon.  As to the permethrin inside, it's permethrin and it works great if properly applied and used.  If you can afford clothing infused with permethrin by the manufacturer (ExOfficio, Columbia) you're better off in terms of longevity and ultimately price, as the effectiveness of this after-applied product is rated at only the lesser of 6 washings or 42 days of ordinary use.

1016,5.0,True,"12 10, 2014",A20NU3M9JVNPBZ,B0002WRHE8,ShannonD,"With the now hundreds of reviews for this item, what can I say that has not already been published about this heater? I have few things. First, I also own the Portable Buddy and while it is a good heater, it has its draw backs. The first thing I like better in comparison is the control knob of the Big Buddy, it's very smooth and ignites readily, it's also responsive and seems like it is better quality than the Portable Buddy unit. The handle is solid and does not fold down. The legs of the unit are soft rubber and non-adjustable. For a heater this size (I actually did gasp when I first got it, compared to the Little buddy) I think it would have been a plus. Having spoke about the legs, they are very soft and should play nice on wood floors. The unit is not very heavy and is easily carried with its sturdy handle. I'll say the fan is more gimmick than functional, but it does help throw out the heat to a degree. Do not expect blower style air out of the fan, it can run off of D cell batteries or an adapter that is sold separately (I wish I had sprung for the adaptor). I did spring for the quick connect propane hose by Mr. Heater for hooking up 20-40lb propane cylinders. If you buy the regulated quick connect hose you DO NOT have to buy the filters for running bulk propane. This is a money saver in the long run and worth it. The regulator inlet for the quick connect is located next to one of the inlets (opposite side of the control knob) for 1lb bottles and is easily accessible. This heater can be hooked up to (2) bulk propane tanks at the same time using connection hoses for bulk propane 20lb cylinders adapted to the 1lb  connector or (1) 20lb bulk tank using the quick connect hose (to clarify for absolute clarity it only has (1) quick connect inlet and has an additional (2) propane inlets that are fitted for 1lb bottles. You may also run (1) or (2) 1lb propane bottles at the same time. The heater does well on the LOW settings and MEDIUM settings, the second element does not light until you turn it to HIGH setting. It does not matter what side you hook up propane to or in what manner you hook it up, the heater will run normally and work on all of its temperature settings (yes this was brought up in other reviews and is a source of confusion). The heater puts out a lot of heat on the HIGH settings and other reviews of the 1lb bottles freezing up on HIGH  settings are more than likely accurate. This is no fault to the heater, it's just that on HIGH this thing eats up a good bit of propane and over a period of time empties those 1lb bottles more quickly, thus the moving gas freezes up the bottle. In a warm room this phenomenon may not occur and I'm not saying it always will, just don't be surprised if they do freeze under certain conditions. The Heater will NOT freeze a bulk tank 20lb or higher, I know this for a fact, I've tried. Durability wise the heater is a well built unit that has been running every night of the week in my garage for the last 5 weeks, and there's not been a single hiccup. my Portable Buddy has been put through hell and still runs like a champ, this one should be no different.  The safety shut off Is very sensitive and at the first sign of tipping it shuts the heater down, I think this is an excellent feature. There is no smell with this heater, it puts off pure heat with no weird odors. The connections seem machined well and I have never had a problem using my Mr. heater hoses. The instruction manual is well layed out and tells it like it is, if you cannot understand this manual then you should not be using the heater, it's that easy. For the price range, features, durability, safety features and portability it is a no brainer purchase. The heater feels well made and puts out a good bit of heat. I use mine consistently for long stretches at a time and it works without issue. In an emergency situation I would trust it. If it were stolen, I would be sad and then buy another one.
I hope this helps in your decision.

1023,3.0,False,"09 25, 2013",A3UKWQS8SRW6IO,B00004ZAVI,OrchidSlayer,"I have tried numerous supposedly squirrel-proof feeders over the years.  This is a pretty basic design.  The top keeps squirrels from crawling down fro the top (but they can still jump from nearby branches if not carefully placed).  The bottom is on a spring that closes when the weight of a bigger squirrel (grey) lands.  However, some smaller squirrels, like red, or chipmunks are too light to lower the bottom and can access the seed.

These kind of feeders usually work well for a year or two, then get knocked down by deer or bear and the top gets chewed by something (probably the grey squirrels).  They do work pretty well until that time.

I have had it hanging for nearly 6 months and have had very little bird interest.  I think it is because I primarily use black oil sunflower seed and they just don't come out well from this feeder.  The benefit of this is that squirrels and deer are not able to tip the seed out. The downside is that the birds also have trouble.  My other feeders are filled with birds and empty quickly.  This pretty much just sits there unless the other feeders are emptied.  I could switch to a seed mix, but the majority of that goes uneaten.  Safflower would probably work, but that isn't very popular in my area.

I do think it is very hard to fill.  I had to add an s-hook between the feeder and top baffle to be able to hang it easily.  I won't buy another if a bear steals this.","Best for small seed, not whole sunflower seeds",1380067200

Over the years, I've found that the best buy is black oil sunflower seeds, which attract a wide variety of birds and is available in 20-lb bags for about $16 (or about 80 cents per pound).  The Lyric Chickadee blend contains a mix of sunflower seeds and nuts (including peanuts, pecans, and pistachios) and costs four times as much as the sunflower seeds I usually buy.

Don't get me wrong, this stuff looks and smells good, and the birds in my yard seemed to enjoy it.  But they also enjoy the sunflower seeds I usually put out.  So I have to ask myself whether it's worth spending four times the money to go ""gourmet.""  Personally, I'd like a big bowl of pecans and pistachios rather than sunflower seeds, but this is bird food!  And I really don't think the birds in my neck of the woods can tell the difference.

If you are an occasional bird feeder (meaning you don't buy bird seed all that often), a bag of this isn't a big problem.  But the 4-pound bag filled just one of my feeders, and it was gone in three days (the same amount of time it takes for the birds to consume a feeder-full of sunflower seeds).  It just doesn't make sense to spend four times the money for something that isn't going to make much of a difference (if any) to the birds you're feeding.  If ""fancy"" and ""gourmet"" mean something to you, order this stuff.

* Edging - works much better than I anticipated. It has an edging guide that steers you on your path and the string really does have the power to do the job

* Form factor - the unit is relatively light weight and easy to assemble. The conversion from edger to trimmer is a breeze. My only complaint is that the ""battery"" is really the entire top head of the unit - the black area in the picture. If you have the space to wall mount the charger and hang the recharger then it's not an issue; but if you don't, and you don't want to bring the entire unit inside to charge, then you have to disconnect that entire black head area and plug it in.

We get a fair amount of lightening and thunder storms here in Florida. They come out of nowhere sometimes. Just after getting the fence system set up and our dog trained on it (very important), a storm blew in and knocked out the power. When it came back on a minute later, something jolted the PetSafe unit and it set the collar off. My dog was running for her life and yelping as I tried catching her! Poor girl. It zapped her for the entire time until I finally caught her. Now, I remove the collar the second she gets to the door to come inside and never have it on in the house. It's a small inconvenience but never do I want to put my dog through this again. Beware of this as it will cause tremendous trauma to your pet if it happens to them! Other than that, it works fine. Be sure to train your dog as per the instructions and as my trainer has showed us, pick the dog up and carry him/her over the barrier line to the street and back in your yard when going for a walk to avoid confusing the dog's permitted area. If your dog is too large to pick up, put him/her in your car and park at end of driveway or street (past permitted fence line) and start your walk from there. It seems to work well for both of our Bluetick Coonhound/Pointer doggies. They do not get confused or associate this method with the fence line so they do not pass it when inside of it. One last tip: Tip: look under ""used"" for an open box item in Amazon Warehouse (click on ""used"" and look for Amazon as seller). You can really save when purchased this way direct from Amazon!

I eat cereal (preferably granola) for breakfast every morning, so I'm always willing to try something different.  While I don't need to eat gluten-free, I do need to eat dairy-free and prefer all natural.

This granola, I think, has a good flavor.  It's one I'd get tired of after a few bags though.  I wish they'd make the nuts into smaller pieces so you'd feel like you had more.  Whole cashews and walnuts are great, but without many in the bag, you feel a little deprived.

Be prepared to chew.  A lot.  This granola is very chewy and takes a long time to eat.  Seriously, some people will have a jaw ache after a sizable bowl of this.  I have TMJ so a lot of chewing can be uncomfortable or painful, and this granola aggravates it.  May sound crazy but it's true!

We know that some of our customers won't be able to use the same TurboTax product as last year. So purchase the product you normally get and then call one of my team members ... so they can get you the upgrade necessary to meet your needs.
By the way, if we did this for revenue purposes we would have targeted a segment of our customer base much larger than the 2-4% who are affected by this change.""

I say:
""One of the challenges of buying things from your company is that we don't know how and when you will make arbitrary and inexplicable changes to your product for returning customers like us.  We now know that you don't care that some of your customers won't be able to use the same TurboTax product as last year.  We *did* want to purchase the product we normally got - and then actually GET the product that we have normally gotten - without now having to call and beg for it.
By the way, why did you target *any* segment of your customer base for this treatment?  If not for revenue, then was it just to confuse them, or to annoy them, or to intentionally drive them away?""

BACKGROUND:  I've used Paint Shop Pro for years.  In fact, I began using PSP back in the days of Compuserve when I could download a few shareware programs and my employer paid for any that I wanted to keep.  I'm not a graphics artist, but when I need to do any kind of image editing, I can usually find my way around in PSP to do what I need to do.

WHAT I LIKE:

- Installed easily, boots up without issues
- Seems speedy for the amateur that I am
- Has a full set of functions and features

WHAT COULD BE BETTER

In the old days, making a simple web graphic was easy to do.  PSP is so sophisticated now as a Photoshop replacement, it's sometimes not easy to create a simple graphic.  I wish that there were a rich set of wizard functions that would start with a goal in mind, and then have the wizard walk through all the steps involved.  Sometimes I have a simple goal in mind, but it's hard to know where to begin.

That portion of the program is excellent.  You can connect, find what you need, have it automatically inserted into the right place and lots of other wonderful things with Ancestry.com.  This allows you to build a family tree quickly and is tremendously helpful if you are new or just recently started building your history.

On the other hand, this is one of the most awkward programs available to try to figure out how to do anything manually.  If you were trying to build your history by hand by talking to relatives and the like then doing things like adding a step-parent, half-sibling, child out of wedlock, etc, is a nightmare.  It can be done, but it is far from intuitive.  I have used FTM from very early versions and loved it through the first several iterations.  I started with Version 5 and loved it through version 11, then it started being more focused on features at the expense of the user interface and ease of use.  And with this version it further frustrates the user experience.  The Version 2008 was the last one I would deem user friendly.

The automatic portion can also be confusing as I found myself thinking I had downloaded content that it turns out I had not.  When I was not connected to the Internet the content was not there, but when I connected it showed up again.  It apparently keeps several items on the Internet by default.  However, I did find that I could get it onto my local copy, it was just not intuitive how to do it.

Don't get me wrong, this is great software and does pretty much everything you need.  There are just better choices if you are trying to build or edit by hand.  The bottom line is it is the best for automatically building your tree through Ancestry.com (absolutely the best online resource).  If you want to do anything else, or have to make a change in any kind of relationship, then it is one of the hardest to work with.  It will do it, but expect to spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to do it and going through the help manual and probably online help.

For me, I am using the subscription to gather information and then just imputing it into my older version.  Reports are faster, interface is cleaner, easier to make changes, searches for duplicates, exports, etc are all faster in the older version.

I'm able to get through all my entries easily, and file my taxes with ease.  My situation is simple though, with main work income, interest from savings accounts, and a few dividends and stock sales. I don't deduct much since I don't own a home.

H&R Block Tax Software does a great job of going through every section step-by-step. The program does a great job of providing additional information for any section or question they ask.  The calculations have been accurate for me all three years. I usually file in March, and I also run through other online programs to verify that they calculate the same refund or amount owed.

It imported my data from the previous year. And when it was time to file, it did it without any problems. I love this software. I also loved the Turbo Tax software when I was using it years ago.

So what changed (other than the unconscionable increase in price)?  Well in 2014 TurboTax suddenly discovered that it had been incorrectly calculating depreciation on foreign rental properties.  Instead of using a 40 year life the software used a 27.5 year life, which only applies to properties located within the US.  This occurred year after year despite the fact that TurboTax explicitly asked if the property was located in a foreign country, to which I always checked the ""Yes"" box.

Because of this flaw all of my tax returns going back to 2005 had incorrectly claimed too much depreciation on my Canadian rental property, thereby requiring me to file a complicated Form 3115 to request a change in accounting convention.  Furthermore, I have to report extra income over the next four years so the IRS can recover the excess depreciation I took.  This, in turn, pushed me into a higher tax category and increased the amounts I will have to pay in Medicare premiums.

Judging from the outcry on the Turbotax user forum, many others were also affected by this incorrect depreciation calculation.  I suspect that thousands of taxpayers were impacted.  So why hasn't anyone filed a class action suit against TurboTax?  Well, if you read the software license, by using the software you give up your right to sue Intuit and must settle your grievance in binding arbitration.  Arbitrators almost always find in favor of the company so why even bother going there.  Furthermore, the fine print in the software license states that Turbotax does not guarantee that the software will produce the right answer so you use it at your own risk.  How convenient - for Intuit.

I have had it with this shoddy company.  I'm switching to the new guy on the block: TaxAct.  It is much cheaper and hopefully more accurate.  If it is not I will switch again - bit not to TurboTax.

As long as an account is setup before trying to downloading the product, it downloaded and installed easily for me. Yes, it took time. After all, this is a bloated Microsoft product. This version of Office is sort of a hybrid, or so it feels - partly in the cloud, but mostly on your computer. That it good for people on the go and need to access documents that may have been saved at different locations on different machines or devices. Documents can be saved to the Skydrive associated with your account. In order to use this program, unlike a standard office version, you must be logged into the account you created, or a previous account that can be linked to the subscription. The subscription includes free apps (must be downloaded from the app stores) for iPhone and I would imagine Android and Windows mobile as well, which allow viewing and editing documents as well as accessing the Skydrive from a mobile device (Don't tell the boss about this).

The new look of Office 365 is more in line with Windows 8, but it is flat, colorless and dull. Microsoft does not give you many options to change it either. There are three different themes to choose from - White, Light Gray and Dark Gray. Wow! Microsoft really? I would at least have expected a light blue like Office 2007 offered. At least if White or Light Gray is chosen there is a thin line of color at the bottom status bar, with dark gray chosen this is black. The color changes based on the program being used - blue for Word, green for Excel, etc. There is also a background pattern that can be chosen which is really just in the top right hand corner of the screen. These uninteresting patterns are grey, but vary in shade based on the ""theme"" chosen. Pretty unexciting.

As far as functionality goes, Office hasn't changed that much in the last few versions, there is a customizable ribbon at the top which changes based on the tab that is chosen. Microsoft has done away with any sort of shading or shadowing to make the ribbon stand out in any way, it is incredibly flat looking, which is kind of disconcerting, and at times confusing. Clicking on ""File"" (which for some reason always has a colored box around it) slides open another screen where there are other options. This is where more of a Windows 8 look comes into play (and a little bit more color). The options are pretty much the same as in other Windows versions, just presented differently. Save As offers an option to save to the computer as well as to the Skydrive. Microsoft installs a program that loads when the computer is started that keeps the Skydrive in sync with all the documents saved there. The icon in the computer's toolbar is a cloud with a green line moving from left to right. Because it is constantly synching, there is a noticeable, but not intolerable lag when typing, as compared to a non-cloud based system.

Office 365 comes with a license for up to 5 PC's or Macs which makes the $99.00 a year (at time the of review) price a good deal if utilizing all of them, since it offers the full Office suite, 20 GB storage on the Skydrive and 60 minutes of Skype per month all included in the subscription. It does not turn out to be such a good deal if it is only being used on one PC or Mac, in which case it might be better to get a non-subscription version which costs more upfront, but can be used until its obsolescence at no charge. The other versions offer the same features without the Skype credits and less storage space on the Skydrive. Windows 7 or 8 is required to run any new version of Microsoft Office product.

Microsoft Office is pretty much the world standard for software of this type. Other software has come and gone, so it is almost essential to own some version of Office these days. While Office 365 is not my favorite version that Microsoft has created, it's not that bad either. The lack of color makes their product boring and hard to navigate, and because there is no option to change this is frustrating. Microsoft needs to put some style into its office products.",A Lack Of Color Makes A Boring Interface,1380240000

Windows 8 offered a brand new start and purported to also provide security enhancements. Since someone had also invaded my Hotmail account and was using it to send marketing pitches to others, I thought Windows would solve all my problems. Instead, it brought innumerable new headaches and frustrations, thanks to its confusing and difficult to learn interface . (I greatly prefer use of a keyboard and mouse instead of a touchscreen.)

Using Windows 8 is akin to decades-ago games such as Super Mario where one was constantly hunting for hidden coins or secret passages; in Windows 8 those coins/secret passages provide the means to access important screens and options. Unfortunately, they don't reliably appear even when one knows exactly where they're hidden. On the plus side, it is now easier to rid one's computer of Bing and replace it with Google, once and for all. Another negative, while hardly important, is that the new Solitaire is less user-friendly than the one that came with Windows 7.

As usual, the flagship product is the immensely powerful vector drawing program, CorelDraw. It is intuitive to use but comes with a comprehensive help file that does an excellent job of explaining the major topics. It is always available directly on the interface.
Added to this are the (now) great number of videos and tutorials available online. Time was, a search on YouTube provided not many results (as compared to some other suites). This has changed and I believe Corel has undertaken an effort to introduce its suite of products to more people, who are in turn producing content on their behalf. There's also an excellent manual available for purchase, which while it is for X6, still pertains.
I noticed that with this new version, the speed of start up is much faster than with X6. Installation is straightforward and easy to navigate though there is at least one puzzling thing where updates always show an Internet Explorer security error message. Work output type is profuse, including PDF. I have never used the image acquisition (TWAIN, WIA) so I can't say much about it. There are a tremendous amount of settings (the RGB profile, for example, is more than 20 items long) so some time will be expended to get really comfortable with it. However, intuitive isn't the wrong descriptor here. You can accept the defaults and play, and still figure out how to produce some pretty good content. Be aware, however, there's a reason it costs a pretty penny to acquire, and why professional T-Shirt graphics designersthe ones I know anywayoverwhelmingly use CorelDraw: it's top-notch software, and to get really good requires study. Luckily, there are now more resources than ever.
If you have multiple monitors, CorelDraw X7 will be a delight to use as you may undock any number of sections to use. I don't have one, but I have seen some work with digital pens (on a tablet) that will blow you away.
Let's be honest, the other ingredient products in the suite aren't as good as Draw. PhotoPaint is a perfectly adequate image manipulation software that does not approach Photoshop or even Corel's other products in the space, PaintShop Pro.

I purchased a digital download version of H&R Block Deluxe plus State. This version entitles you to 5 free federal e-files.  You can print and mail as many returns as you want, there is no limit on printing.

One state software is included in the package but the package does NOT include free e-file for the state return (see one exception below). If you want to e-file  your state return you will need to pay a fee of $19.95 to e-file each state return. Alternatively, you can print all the forms and mail them using US post office.  If you need to file taxes for an additional state, each additional state is $39.95 plus $19.95 e-file fee.  Ouch!

Note: NY state residents can e-file state returns for free.

 GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until January 9, 2014.

 H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version.  That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. Last year I had to do both and I found the guidance in Deluxe package was sufficient to complete the forms.

 Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on ""learn more"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

 H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

 DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC.  You no longer need to enter this information on H&R web site.  I prefer having this information locally on my PC for better security.  The change from web site to local PC was introduced last year and I was happy to see that this change is here to stay.

 I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

 I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past years had display issues on some forms (text boxes were display overlapping each other on some forms). This year all forms displayed properly.

 I usually purchase tax software as early as possible to help me with end year tax planning. However, if timing is not important to you be aware that the price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter ""Amazon price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word camel in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached.  During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

 For folks trying to download State Forms. The state forms are not available as of 11/17/2013. You have an option of entering email where you will be notified as soon as the form for your state becomes available. Alternatively, you can go to H&R website, click on ""Download Software"" on the top banner, and select ""State Editions"".  Currently it says ""Available in January 2014"".

When the state forms will become available they can be downloaded by selecting the State Tab and then clicking on the button labelled ""Buy"" (a little scary since we already paid for it) but then ""buy"" will turn into ""update"" and the forms will be downloaded to your computer.

 At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

 Update: To post an answer to a good question asked via a comment:  Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
 Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

 Update: Several people asked me via comments if Schedule C is included in Deluxe edition because it is not explicitly mentioned in the description.  Schedule C form is included and covered in the interview.

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years.  I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.

If you have never used Quicken before, I would rate this a 5 star; if you are an experienced user doing an upgrade, I would rate this a 3 as there really is not any new functionality or, if there is, I can't see it for the tasks I perform with Quicken.

I made a backup of my existing file, and proceeded to install.  Installation went without a hitch, and I didn't even need the backup as this installation recognized my file and took over from there with the conversion process: the conversion took some time to complete, so if you are doing an upgrade go find something to do around the house vs. sitting there staring at your computer.

For the new user, this is one heck of a bookkeeping package.  I highly recommend setting up the interface with your banks, investment accounts, etc. and have it automatically download to your software.

Learning on the computer has been a new and fairly positive experience for me. The package comes with a number of elements: the base software, the particular language elements to plug into the base software, audio companion CDs for review offline and a USB headset/microphone.

Installation is a two part process, 1) install the base software, 2) install any language element tiers. (The headset will need some installation time, but that should be managed by the system). The installation progressed pretty smooth, took a reasonable amount of time, no errors.

The process of learning is geared toward an immersive process where you start speaking pretty much right at the start (kind of like being tossed into the pool and told to swim). You start by selecting your goals (read, write, speak, etc.) and then follow the lesson plan, reviewing as often as necessary. My personal experience has been that I enjoy the immersive process, I am still working through the lessons, but I fell that I have gained considerably more than I have in past language learning opportunities. The process has been a fairly painless process, and I devote time when available.

My bottom line is that the product is pretty pricey, but gives you one of the best learning experiences I can imagine short of being dropped off in Mexico. P-)",Better than Spanish 101,1218672000

1186,5.0,False,"06 25, 2014",ADFLPF6FI3W0O,B00JC5Y4FQ,ASP,"Item: Cyberlink PowerDVD 14 Ultra, Rating 4.5 stars.
I really enjoy this software for playing files. I've used older versions without problems. I've also used WinDVD versions as well, and like that program too. I use more of Cyberlink's other programs like Power2Go and Director.

Install process: The install is straightforward and only took 5 minutes. After install, enter the product key, then you need an internet connection for the product activation which took 3 seconds.  First, on the Welcome Screen, click on Media Library Preference. In the Movie Library, delete or add folders you want to connect with PowerDVD. It will sync those
folders with the software. Do that for Movies, the Videos/Photos tab, and Music tab.

Next screen is the Cyberlink Cloud Service. Redeem you free one year now or later. You can upload your content from your smartphone to the cloud to be accessed later on by your other devices.

After setup was complete, I ran the updates, and that was a fairly quick process. Interface: It's a very clean and organized interface. You can drag files into the player and it will begin playing them. It's a fast program and processes everything quickly. I'm running a AMD Quad-Core processor 64-bit, with 8GB RAM, and a 1GB ATI video card. You can also create playlists of various files. I noticed that the software had automatically associated certain files with the software. While I prefer using other programs. You can change the program back by right-clicking a file and selecting ""Choose default program"" and then select the program and make sure ""Always use this as default program"" is checked. There are instructions online to change programs associated with files. This should never have been done. I'm subtracting 1/2 a star for it. But since I'm experienced with this stuff it doesn't bother me much. Others may be annoyed.

In creating PowerDVD 14 Ultra, Cyberlink knew they had to bring a much morepromising experience to PC users.  This whole package was created to be a seamless and easy to share experience.  You can easily share to Facebook, Flickr, YouTube, or Vimeo. For those who like using Vimeo forvideo-sharing, Vimeo support has also been added in this version.  I own version 11 as well, and had no issues with that version. Version 14 proves to run without problems for me. They've added support for
the new HEVC/H.265 format with this version.

Using a blu-ray optical drive, this software plays DVDs, Blu-rays, 3D Blu-rays and4K Blu-rays.  The software can also view 3D photos and videos.  BD Live is alsosupported. I tried all the types of optical discs mentioned above, and they all
played without any problem. I had to use a different computer and TV to try out the 4k discs. 4K, 3D, and 60fps discs and files require much more processing power and I had to use a 2GB video card and a much better processor.  Everthing ran smoothly.
You can also play AVCHD, MP4, MKV, and M2TS files. A tried all different files mentioned above and they all played properly.

The Ultra version includes PowerDVD Remote v2, and Power Media Player (for Android/iOS and also Windows). PowerDVD Remote requires you to install an app on or iOS or Android device, and then you can use that as a remote control, or a
wireless mouse pad and keyboard for PowerDVD.  The app works well for me on my iPhone.

CLOUD: Included with the software is a free one-year subscription of 10GB to Cyberlink's Cloud service. Price after is $10 per every 10GB of storage. You can upload your files to their cloud service and access them anywhere. The cloud
service works fast on a fast connection, but remember it depends on how fast your connection is.

Normally, I use my big-screen LCD TV, PS3 blu-ray payer, and 7.1 speaker setup for my optical disc movie-watching needs. Since I can connect my PCs to my medium-size monitor or my big-screen TV, I'm available to view all my other files that aren't on optical discs.

INCLUDED: Also included are trial versions of other Cyberlink products: PhotoDirector 5, PowerDirector 12, DirectorSuite 2, Power2Go 9, YouCam 6, and MediaEspresso 6.7. Some of them I've used before and they are really good.","Great program for viewing optical discs and files, clean interface",1403654400

I used to have a cheaper mat that was supposedly thicker than this mat but did not offer even half of the cushioning that this mat provides. I do a ton of hot yoga and this mat has held up wonderfully. It did need a few weeks and a thorough wash with dish soap to break it in. I think that most of the reviewers who complain about how slippery this mat is failed to properly clean and break in the surface. It has a slippery protective coating on it when its first shipped to you and you need a good deep cleaner (I used Dawn dish soap) to get it off. Once the coating is off, the mat grips great and continues to do so through months of heavy use. When I originally got it and was breaking it in, I always rolled it with the top on the outside to keep it from curling up when unrolled. Now that its fully broken in, I don't have to turn it over to roll it. I can roll it with the top side in and it still rolls out to lay completely flat even if Ive gotten ill and too busy with work and its gone over a week between uses.

1. I don't think this disc is waterproof.  I was throwing with my friends by the creek one night and the disc landed in the water multiple times.  It was fine at the time, but some days later I tried to turn it on, and the light gave a feeble poot and died.  I'd used the disc a ton up to that point, so I suppose it could have been the battery, but I'm thinking it was the water.  If I ever replace the battery and see if it works, I'll update the review.

2. This disc will warp if you leave it in a hot car.  That is exactly what I did.  I left it sitting upside down on the back seat of my car for maybe a week during late spring, and when I went to find it, it was warped. Warped to the point it would wobble when thrown, and despite rigorous bending and many games of ultimate, the disc has only slightly returned to its normal shape.

I needed to round the edge of a 1"" piece of oak, and the rounding bit has a ""shoulder"" that needed to be above the work surface. So the larger hole in the sub-base enabled me to raise the bit so that only the curved portion engaged the wood. Evidently the thinking behind the smaller hole is to make the router more stable for hand-held use, but I found it no problem to work with the larger hole.

This puppet is for my boyfriend who loves chameleons. He really wants a Jackson, but we haven't had the space for one yet. I saw this guy and figured it was perfect. I attach some horns to a headband and write a little note with a backstory claiming he is a real Jackson Chameleon ""I swear!"" and that he just needs a place to stay the night where it's warm.

Choosing the puppets for the recipient, thinking of a story to go with it-- I think I may have more fun than the person getting the puppet! Though I hope not... but if anything it will be memorable.

Note: please see the pictures I added for a close up of the face and a (blurry! sorry!) long shot which shows the puppet on my arm for a perspective of its size in relation to the human body. For reference I am 5'6"" and this is what the chameleon puppet looks like on my arm! If you can see, the opening to control the puppet is in the mid-belly, up through into the head, where you can wiggle the eyes, open and close the mouth and manipulate his long stretchy tongue...

He watches the big noisy truck coming down the street and reaching out to grab the garbage containers. Up they go and get dumped into the truck. Back they come down and get plopped back onto the street. Man, that's high entertainment! Then comes ours and he screams with joy. Then the garbage-man looks out at the boy and waves at the truck pulls away. It just doesn't get any better! Toddlers can be so easy to entertain!

In any case, my wife noticed how interested in the garbage truck the kid was and picked up this Bruder Toys Roadmax Garbage Truck for him. It looks quite different in details than our own city garbage trucks (especially the colors) but the boy knew immediately that it was a garbage truck. He loved it! He was playing with it right away and that night we had to let him sleep with it.

The truck strikes me as quite a quality toy, definitely above that of his other plastic toys. Of course, it's more expensive too. The expense doesn't bother me as long as he gets a lot of use out of it and it holds up well. The truck is nice looking and nicely put together with good fit and finish. It's hard to say with a toddler, but it appears to be sturdy and I expect it to have a fairly long life span. In any case, so far it's a big hit!

Anyways, this game is quite possibly my favorite or atleast 2nd favorite game for PS2 ever made, i bought my PS2 late in general, in 2005 when it first went slim so my lateness on both the game and the console was quite harassing however it did not hamper the gameplay in ANY WAY what so ever, really wish i could have played it a year after its original release though but hey still got to play this Grade A game.

My annoying nostalgia aside, i still play this game today on my ps2 backward capable PS3 (yes they still exist) and its amazing when its up scaled to HD. still a very fun game. it looks like a PSP game to be quite honest which it should have had some sort of port by now but, the demand is surprising rather high but regardless it never got the sequel it so deserved nor got a true HD remake.

As you might know, its been compared to games like God of War (1) and Devil May Cry (1), however imo its better then both and other hack n' slash games at the time of its original release and after.

Alrighty time for the actual review..

I. Presentation ~ Has a very gothic fantasy feel to it, even with its out-dated graphics you will have a hard time finding a game with a vibe like this one really nice and enjoyable, and the lead character has style even if his role is very generic hero trying to do what is right. 9/10

II. Graphics ~ At the time of its release this game was a graphical powerhouse of a game, with TONS of enemies on screen at once and amazing Euro castles, towns, dungeons, stormy zones (even though it oddly never actually rains in this game once for some reason) cloudy weather, gives you that cold sort of feeling, Monsters are well details, textures in general are good, there Wii/PSP quality lets just keep it at that. Oh and i almost forgot, NO LAG even with all of the above mentioned. it also has no issues playing on Backwards capable PS3's. 8/10

III. Sound ~ The OST in this game is one of the best ever, i've played alot of games, but not many even in our current generation comes close to the epicness that is Chaos Legions Gothic/Choir/Opera/Rock/Metal/Fantasy melodies. 10/10

IV. Gameplay ~ Unlike other hack n' slash action games, *cough* DMC/GoW/DW/PoP *cough* from back then to even present day, it takes true skill and strategic tactics to attain victory here, if you can be this game on its hardest mode, give your self a pat on the back, because your hardcore. very fun gameplay and unique, not many games have been able to try and copy it, the closest thing to CL's combat style is a game called Folklore on PS3, other then that not many come close. 9.5/10

V. Lasting Value ~ This will vary from person to person, i got around 40 to 50 hours out of it. 9/10

VI. Extras ~ There is other content to unlock such as the true ultimate legion from its baby stages to its true angelic form and theres also a 2nd playable character Arcia a gunslinger lady with Vincent Valentine like gameplay, however her playthrough is non~cannon and is only for fun purposes only, shes much weaker then Sieg in ever way but does have ranger on her side. 8/10

VII. Conclusion ~ One of my favorite PS2 games of all time that missed its chance to be a even better PSP game with new content or a PS3 collections game. 9.2/10",A Hidden jewl among PS2 games.,1293840000

1) Gameplay: This really is 2 games in 1.  It has the ENTIRE Tony Hawk 2 game in here, with the same challenges and stuff.  Only with a ton of improvements.  The graphics are so much better (get to that later), you can now listen to your own music on the hard disk, you can create a person (more options and...better graphics).  Just about everything is better.  But that's just the beggining.  Once you beat the game, you unlock 2x mode.  What's that?
2x mode is basilcy a whole new game, with 5 BRAND *NEW* levels for your XBOX to enjoy.  You can basicly complete different goals, but instead of getting cash, you get tapes (wow, CREATIVE!).  When you get a certain number of tapes, you earn a new park to skateboard in.  And, again, you can listen to your own music, and the graphics kick...toosh!
2) Graphics: HUGE improvement.  Example, instead of grass just being a flat surface colored green, it has individual blades of grass, blowing in the wind, getting crushed and loose when you skate over it.  Everything is sharper, more clear and focused.  And, while certain areas didn't really get touched upon, the things that did (example: the snow in The Hangar), are much appreciated.  Excellent job Activision, you realized that the XBOX has more power than the PlayStation!
Seriously though, the graphics look a TON better.  Definantly worth the work.  Almost a new game.
3) Multiplayer: Basicly everything #2 had, including the same places to skate (plus the new 2x levels), all the same games (Trick Run, Tag, Horse, Free Skate, etc...).  Now with the ability to play with 4 controller, and AGAIN, listen to your own music.
Great game, worth your buy if you find it.  Everything that was #2 with the power of XBOX, Personal Soundtracks, and new levels to try.  All for less than 10 bucks in most places.

It combines new ideas with the best graphics on a console racing game, and manages to mix arcade-style action and realism in a way that's not been seen previously.  In MSR, you race through 25 chapters, each with 10 races (over 250 tracks!) in any of three different cities:  San Francisco, London, or Tokyo.  The time of day in each city corresponds to the Dreamcast's inner clock -- so if you're playing the game in L.A. at 10 pm, it's 6 am when you race a London track -- very cool.  Ambient sounds arise as the day begins as well:  if you're racing in the dead of night you'll hear Big Ben chime the hours, but as day breaks (quite a sight to see -- the sky slowly becomes lighter gray, shadows appear...it's not SUDDENLY DAYLIGHT -- and wait'll you see the sun SET over the Golden Gate bridge -- breathtaking) you'll gradually hear traffic in the background, as well as sounds of construction, birds, etc.  Put this together with the hyper-realistic graphics (each city is modeled after its real-life counterpart with painstaking accuracy, and there's no pop-up or slowdown whatsoever, even in multiplayer mode) and you have a racing environment unlike any other.  Your car is even fitted with a radio that has three unique stations for each city, including news, weather, commercials, and music.  At last -- not the same techno beats race after race (but you could use the car's custom CD player to do that if you wanted).  MSR contains over 40 cars, from MGs to Mazdas to Porsches, and you can choose the color, transmission, license plate, and even window tint and rooftop style(topless, hard, or soft), and they look and sound incredible.  You can't fiddle with engines or suspensions, true, but each car has its own Kudos rating, as well as top speed, acceleration, drive type, and so on.  Kudos is another innovation:  a unique point system that must be satisfied in order to progress through the chapters, unlocking ever more tracks and cars.  Each of the 10 tracks in a chapter presents you with a challenge, which varies hugely from a standard multicar race to a time challenge to a game of How Many Cars Can You Pass Within a Time Limit? and many others.  Outstanding variety -- it's not simply a battle for first place.  You are able to customize the limits in order to attain the maximum Kudos as well:  think you can beat the 40 second time limit for a lap?  Change it to 35.  Even 30.  But be warned:  fail to attain your own goal and you lose Kudos big time.  MSR compels you to get better with a wonderful learning curve that you can actually adjust to your own ability.  And you can re-race any race in any chapter at any time in order to get more Kudos, even using Jokers to double the number of Kudos you gain....but you can lose the same amount, so be cautious when you gamble!  There's definitely a rush when you beat your lowered time limit, finally gaining enough Kudos to open another track!  MSR handles great -- the handbrake works to perfection, enabling you to perform a Kudos-earning skid, but watch out for the walls -- hit em and you lose Kudos.  As the game says, ""It's not how fast you drive, it's how you drive fast.""  At the end of each race, you're awarded Skill and Style points, and penalized for each crash, and then further adjustments are made based on if you beat the challenge or not. Graphics-wise, control-wise, and gameplay-wise, MSR sets new standards for racing games.  Add in a fantastic multiplayer mode (you can also up/download track times via the Internet) with several different options, and it's easy to see that this is the best racer to ever appear on any console.  It appeals to casual and hardcore, sim nuts and arcade junkies.  We DC owners sure have it good:  Soul Calibur, Code Veronica, NFL2K1, Shenmue, Jet Grind Radio...and now Metropolis Street Racer, an absolute classic that'll be praised and remembered fondly for a long time.",At last -- the Best Racer Ever,979776000

Brilliant! As those Guiness guys would say...

The key to this game is stealth and not all out running and gunning. If you fight upwards of two guys at a time, you will die. Its pretty much that simple.

But to help you in your stealth mission is a boatload of cool gadgets that would make James Bond blush. You got silenced handguns and machine guns. Thermal goggles. Night vision goggles. Mine detectors. And the simple yet fun cardboard boxes.

Every item in this game has its own special and unique uses from ketchup to cigarettes.

And the best part of this game are the boss battles. Each boss is truly unique, memorable, and a joy to fight. You will have a blast from Psycho Mantis to the Ninja to the climatic battle vs the towering Metal Gear.

This game was voted as the greatest Playstation game of all time by both IGN and Gamespot and for good reason. It is simply one of the best games ever made and already a timeless classic.",Video game perfection.,1150588800

I thought this game was awesome. Especially the beginning, Forest Of Silence! The music and sound effects are great and the game story is good. The controls may take a while to get used to but if you like games with a challenge, get this. I think that fighting skeletons gets boring after a while but I think when you get to higher levels, (I'm not sure of this) there will be more vicious enemies to fight for your pleasure. I thought the game could have been a little more...well....diverse and detailed, but where I am now, is awesome! I have to say, I bought this at Fucoland and I had no idea I would like it this much. I rented it once before and I hated it because it was so hard. Really, I just didn't put my mind to it and look where I am now. I'm in the 1st castle! This is a great action-RPG game that will keep you hooked for hours. I would recommend that 10 and up should play this game because of the theme and the bloody scenes. There isn't much of a story to this game but for me, that's okay. But for serious gamers (I think I am but this game is so good that I don't really care about the story) you might be a little ticked off because of the lack of story. There many levels for you to get through and they all take a long time. The Forest Of Silence took me about 3 hours to figure everything out (no cheats no guide no nothing). There are two charaters to chose from. Reinhart and a girl (I forgot her name). Now Reinhart has a sword and a whip to fight off enemies and to destroy other things. I think he is better than the girl because he has a stronger weapon. The girl has a energy ball that takes 2 seconds to charge up. I don't like that because if an enemy is comming towards you, you have to charge. She also has these two....rings they look like. She uses that to slice things, just like Reinhart's sword. There are two modes you can go through. Easy and Normal. Normal is not that hard but there is quite a difference between that and easy. There are some options that you can do like the controls and stuff. As I mentioned before, their isn't much of a storyline but when you start the game, there is some. So that makes the game better.

Arguably the single most important videogame in history, SUPER MARIO BROTHERS, along with the Nintendo Entertainment System (hereafter referred to as the NES) singlehandedly resurrected the video game industry after the historic crash of 1983-1984. Rather than reviewing the game itself, which has been done many times, I think many people may find the history how of this revolutionary title came to the videogame industry's rescue very interesting; I know I do. I draw much of this information from various websites, one very good one in particular; unfortunately, I can't really plug them due to Amazon's policies. Email me if you want the websites.

By 1983, the gaming industry, in existence for a mere twelve years, had risen to an astonishing 3.2 billion dollar industry. Atari spearheaded the industry, which introduced its first console in 1977 (Atari Video Computer System), and since had grown to hold two thirds of the entire market. However, in 1984 all this would end with a thunderous crash. This concise overview will show you the history of the home consol crash and how SUPER MARIO BROTHERS came to the rescue.

In 1976, Warner Communications bought Atari for $28 million from the company's founder, Nolan Bushnell. Over the next two years, Atari, suffering major production problems and Bushnell's bizarre management, lost Warner millions. Bushnell and Warner's CEO fought, and in 1978 Bushnell was forced to leave. Warner totally revamped the working style, and in 1979-1980, produced twelve new titles. However, Atari was still dragging down Warner's stock. Struggling to gain the market share, Atari made the smartest move they possible could have; in 1980, they began licensing arcade games, the first being SPACE INVADERS. Over the next two years, Atari overtook the market, bringing in over half of Warner's overall profits.

However, very significant problems would totally destroy the infant industry. In 1981, Atari released PAC MAN on the VCS, and, because it was such a huge arcade hit, quickly became a bestseller. Unfortunately, the quality was very low. This was a major blow to the company's image, with fans and critics alike extremely disappointed.

Another major stumble was one of video games' most infamous games, ET. Warner bought the rights from Spielberg for twenty one million dollars. Atari, expecting the game to be as big a hit as the movie, which was the highest grossing film at that point, purportedly made more ET cartridges than there were consoles themselves. ET proved to be a huge flop, nearly breaking Atari.

By 1983, Atari was in serious trouble. Suing Activision (which was disgruntled Atari employees who broke off and formed their own company) and Imagic, the two leading third party developers, Atari tried to gain control over its software catalogue. Atari lost the suits. Third party developers began popping up overnight, and the industry becomes saturated with very low-quality products. (One of the most controversial is CUSTER'S REVENGE by Mystique, where the goal is to rape a Native American woman while avoiding being shot by arrows.) The third-party developers went bankrupt; these cartridges were heavily discounted, and the major companies couldn't compete. Another factor is the home computer market, that was just starting to come alive in 1984. With an increasing amount of computer games and low prices, people started buying these over the consoles.

All these factors lead to the crash of 1984. In 1983 alone, Atari lost $356 million ($2 million daily). Warner sold Atari to Jack Tramiel, former head of Commodore. The video game industry died, with no major American corporation coming anywhere near it. Enter Nintendo.

A little history here will be highly illuminating as well. What many people don't realise is Nintendo is a very old company, founded in 1889 (yes, you read that right) as a playing card company. It became Japan's largest playing card company, and was very successful. In the 1960s, they moved away from the cards and got into the game and toy markets. (A very interesting sidenote: during that same decade, Nintendo's president opened up a `special hotel' rented `by the hour.' Supposedly, the married president was one of the hotel's top customers). In the 1970s and early 1980s, the company scored significant points with big arcade hits and the Game and Watch product line. In 1983, Nintendo released the Famicom (Family Computer). It was a massive hit in Japan. In 1983, Nintendo went to Atari because they wanted to release the Famicon to the American market. Do to complications I won't go into, the deal fail through. In 1984 they were looking to broaden their market share.

1985, Nintendo announced the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System. They release SUPER MARIO BROTHERS in Japan, scoring a huge hit. In 1986, the NES comes full throttle into the American market, quickly becoming the biggest selling console ever, largely because of this title. The NES owes much of its success to SUPER MARIO BROTHERS. Coming prepacked with the console, there are an estimated 40 million copies of SMB in existence, making it the highest selling video game ever.

Unparalleled, SMB blew open the doors to the videogaming world. With rich palettes of colour, eight four level worlds, spot-on play control, and expert level design, SMB was a much longer game than most of Atari's products and was a game unlike any other at that time. SMB also had the benefit of being very simple to grasp; run, jump, and fire. It was also the first side-sroller as we know it, though Atari's PITFALL set up the concept. Also, it's one of the best. Without SMB, NES wouldn't have been nearly as big a hit.

In the end, Nintendo came at the industry's key moment. With a powerful new console and a very well-designed game, Nintendo resurrected video gaming. With its phenomenal success of the NES and this game, the video game industry once again took off, becoming one of the world's most significant economical contributors.

I read every article in every magazine, and drooled over every screenshot.  When it was finally released, I bought it the day it came out, and my expectations were exceeded.
  Amazingly, the gameplay has been improved over Metal Gear Solid.  With loads of new complex moves and animations, the controls are equally as simple and the characters are equally as fun to maneuver.  I was skeptical about the first-person mode (used primarily for aiming and shooting) at first, afraid the gameplay would lean too far towards tons of gunplay, but once I began to play I realized how well it fit with the stealth gameplay.
  The only aspect of this game that left me a little disappointed was the plot.  There are too many U-turns, especially towards the end, that it seems a bit too far-fetched.

In Majesty, you don't waste your time mining and directing minions to go hither and yon. You build your castle, your kingdom's amenities and, as you can afford themn, hero guilds. Each hero guild can support a certain number of heroes (usually 4), although you'll usually have to buy heroes.
But fret not, because each hero will pay you back many times over by visiting your marketplaces, blacksmiths, inns, and son on. In addition, each guild generates a bit of money on its own, and some provide extra services which can generate revenue.
Your tax collectors will walk from building to building collecting gold, ultimately returning it to your castle or nearby guard houses, while your heroes do whatever they do best. (Rangers explore, rogues steal, and so on.)
The more you build, the more support buildings (peasant huts) will pop up, themselves generating some revenue. Other side effects of urban life (like sewer drains) will appear, too.
The lands are always plagued with some menace or other, however, and its your job as king to make the world safe for--well, your taxpayers. Majesty, however, unlike most other RTSes, gives you no means to directly manipulate your subjects.
If you want a monster dead, then, you must place a bounty on it. If you're trying to destroy the evil crypt generating vampires, you must place a bounty on that. If you want to explore a dark area of the map, you can place an explore flag and try to draw heroes there--for a price.
All-in-all, this formula works, though it's not yet perfected. The balance between building facilities (like the marketplace) and building the guilds/generating heroes that you need to protect your kingdom is very well done. The heroes autonomy is good: Sometimes the destruction of a certain target will result in a greater evil being released, so you'll want to delay that--but your Paladins will have other ideas. On the other hand, your heroes can be so aggressive on their own that they win the game for you while you're not even aware of it.
If you've built a solid infrastructure for your city, you know you've won. The difference between a beginner's game and an expert's game becomes whether you can survive the opening minutes, and occasionally how well you prepare for the trigger event (the accomplishing of one goal that results in a rush of monsters).
So, if the game has a fault, it's that it's too easy. I don't mind; I enjoyed all the scenarios and liked that I could finish them.
Majesty Gold includes the Northern Expansion, an add-on of modest proportions with some tweaks to the rules to make the game harder. The add-on parts, with the tougher, winter-oriented monsters, are quite cool. The tweaks to the game rules, on the other hand, show the game's relative newness. They do make the game harder, but only by way of making it somewhat more frantic in those opening minutes: Even with the tweaks, it's an easy game.
But that's to be expected: The designers can't directly borrow from Starcraft (and clones) to get ideas. They have a new framework to figure out. Majesty 2 is not a shoo-in at this point, but let's hope the developers get a chance to do it. This is an interesting new direction that should be explored.

The buttons are well-placed, and the ergonomic feel of the grip is outstanding. Unlike many other sticks, the Sidewinder offers twisting rudder control, which is key for many flight simulators and games such as MechWarrior.
A couple of items really detract from the experience, however. I found the throttle control to be far too short and far too ""touchy;"" it offers very little resistance, and it's entirely too easy to blast yourself to full throttle without realizing. Also, the joystick is activated when you wrap your finger around it - there's a small beam that, when interrupted, brings the joystick online and upright. The problem here comes when I relax my grip at all - there are times when I want to stretch my fingers out in front of the stick, and then suddenly I find that the stick has gone limp. ARGH! It's also a really large piece of equipment, simply because that's how things are with force feedback right now; but it doesn't easily find space on my fairly-crowded desk.
Despite these detractions, it's still an excellent device overall. There are 7 buttons (three on the top of the stick, four on the base ahead of the throttle control,) plus the trigger and a ""hat"" control. It comes with good software which includes sample force feedback settings - this was the first force feedback stick I've owned, and running it through the automated feedbacks was huge fun. :-)

The graphics are really beautiful, especially the cut scenes. You  can imagine what a ""Freescape 2"" version of Star Trek would be  like. However, the game plays in 2D only unlike Homeworld which is a bit  disappointing. The graphics can sometimes jerk quite easily.
The control  mechanism is quite easy to get used to and makes it enjoyable to play. As  for the reported bugs, I've downloaded the patch from Activision and the  game is running without any problems.
As a Star Trek game it also does  the business of creating the Trek universe really well. There's speach from  Picard and Worf and others during the cut scenes between missions and all  the ships are painstakingly recreated in great detail.

Resident Evil Zero begins with these wierd ameaba creatures attacking a commuter train.  When the S.T.A.R.S. (kind of a para-military elite S.W.A.T. team) goes to investigate, agent Rebecca Chambers is sent to explore the train while her comrades look around the tracks.
Poor Rebecca--right place, wrong time.  When the not-so-dead train mysteriously takes off, some of the very dead commuters re-animate, and her only chance of survival is to pair up with an escaped prisoner.
Yes, Zero still has that clunky Resident Evil control scheme that sometimes leaves you funbling to run or shoot in the right direction.  Yes, Zero is still stingy with the typewriter ribbons and save spots, leaving players struggling to survive as long as possible before saving their progress.
Other things have changed.  You can now jump from Rebecca to Billy (the escaped maniacal killer who's not really so maniacal after all) just by pressing the > button.  The game includes special puzzles for both Billy and Rebecca.
Though I have not finished this game, I can say that it is considerably larger than RE-2.  Zero does still has the pre-rendered backgrounds.  But the graphics in Zero are amazing, even better than the GameCube remake of the original game.
Overall, I would say that Resident Evil Zero is Capcom's best nightmare so far.  Incredible graphics, great story with lots of surprises, and some new devices that bring new live to survival horror.",Resident Evil Reborn,1036281600

Mical,"Neverwinter Nights, the latest D&D (yes, it uses d20 rules) effort from Bioware (of Baldur's Gate fame), is actually three things in one.  First, it is a single-player game that runs 60+ hours of playtime.  Second, it is a multiplayer game, where you can play with up to 64 others online in either the single-player game or a created module.  Third, with the inclusion of the Aurora toolset, it is a complete game editor for those interesting in easily making their own RPGs (and you can make some GREAT ones).
The gameplay itself is smooth and simple.  There is a tutorial to make navigating easier, and to educate the new gamer on the 3rd Ed. rules.  The cameras and movement can be tricky sometimes, and the game doesn't always recognize that the mouse button has been released, meaning you will sometimes pan around when you don't want to, but otherwise everything is laid out logically (unlike the dreadful Arcanum interface) and the hotkeys are easy to remember.  One complaint is that you can't shortcut to do tells in multiplayer, but it's minor.
Graphics and sound are pretty stellar, if you have the hardware to run them.  This game is a real system buster at the highest detail levels, but thankfully come with settings that allow you to tone it down to fit older machines (NOTE: IT WILL NOT RUN ON 3DFX CARDS!)  On the highest detail settings, the game will crash in larger areas, so be warned, and save often.
The single-player game is pretty simple, and the 60 hour estimate seems about right if you do all the subquests and check every barrel for loot.  You can navigate through it with very little effort if you a) talk to everyone, b) kill everything bad, and c) take anything that isn't tied down - basically, the three rules of computer RPGs.  For multiplayer, it's the same thing, except you're going online with up to 64 chums.  The game knows to adjust itself for the party's levels, so even a party of 10 level-20 characters will still have a challenge on the earliest quests, if they choose to do them.  NWN has a game-specific version of GameSpy Arcade built into the game, allowing you to log on quickly and find exactly what you are looking for with zero headache.  In multiplayer, one person can even be the DM, just as he or she would in a tabletop gaming session - a nice feature, but one more open to people playing in larger groups and with their own modules.
The Aurora toolset, or NWN Builder, is where the game truly shines (and this is what convinced me to buy it - for an actual game, I'd rather have Icewind Dale 2).  It's extremely powerful, and you can build rooms populated with monsters and NPCs in less than an hour, and a simple game in a day (the NWN Toolset Guidebook from Versus Books is an essential addition for anyone looking to make their own modules).  As time progresses and most people have solved the in-game modules, this is where NWN will continue, and where the future of online gaming resides.  You don't have to buy an expansion to make use of future games: you can make your own, or download someone else's.  You can make it as hack-and-slash or intrigue-and-talking as you want, and you can customize it for your gaming group, or a specific audience of gamers.  Very cool stuff indeed.
There are some major bugs, though, and a few omissions.  You cannot save while switching areas (or if someone in a multiplayer game is switching areas), or the game crashes.  Too many graphics on slower systems crash the game.  The toolset crashes randomly sometimes, too, especially when customizing the look of NPCs or items.  As far as other complaints, there are only a few.  There aren't any tilesets for things like deserts (I'd love to make an Al-Qadim game), snow, or jungles, or swamps, or other major RPG areas, and as present you can't really make those tiles and import them (hopefully, Bioware will release them in the future).  Also, if you want a monster that isn't in their directory, such as a mind flayer, you have to model it yourself, or find someone with those kind of skills.
Still, as a recently-deployed project still in the earliest stages of development, NWN promises to change the way games are played.  So long MM-RPGs that take $10 a month to play - it's been fun, but not that much fun.  For the RPG fan who sees the possibilities, the sky is really the limit here.  It's now our gaming world.  Now, let's have some fun...

1384,5.0,False,"06 12, 2013",A3UXYCUGIAM9HO,B00002SVFX,aaooppeerr,"Fourteen years ago, I began playing video games on a daily basis, ranging anywhere from the mindless first-person shooters to the more complex and enticing RPG's the world had to offer. I grew up with the classics, and now that I look back on those days, I'm proud I did. But there was one game, among them all, that triggered the gamer's flare within my heart. It was the first game I ever played by myself and finished at a young age, and it ranks as #3 on my Top 10 Best Games of All Time list. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the game that started it all for me: Illusion of Gaia!

STORY: 10/10
When I first played this game, I was far too young to truly understand everything that was going on, but when I turn on the game and play it nowadays, the story always manages to just nearly bring me to tears of joy. You take the role of a boy named Will, who lives in the town of South Cape with his grandma and grandpa. He intends to travel the world in search of his father, a famous explorer named Olman, who disappeared mysteriously after their expedition to the Tower of Babel. Through a series of misguided and unfortunate events, you end up thrown in jail and you have a spiritual conversation with your father, who tells you that the Comet, a star representing total destruction, is heading straight for the planet, and only with the power of the Mystic Statues can you hope to save the world from its untimely doom. If that wasn't enough to already have you hooked, you will be completely and thoroughly engaged into every single line of dialogue from every single character that you come across on your journey. Everybody has something of interest to say, and only a few times could I ever count the dialogue as forgettable. There are plot twists, moments of romance, and a seemingly endless supply of magic and wonder all wrapped up into this game's story, and it's an adventure I will gladly take up any time of any day, over and over again.

GAMEPLAY: 10/10
This beautiful game retains everything good about its predecessor, Soul Blazer, but makes everything more complex and even more challenging. Instead of the traditional level-up system found in almost every single RPG to date, you will become stronger after defeating every single enemy in any area you are currently in. When you defeat every monster, a jewel appears from the last monster destroyed that permanently increases one of your stats by 1 point. You have three stats--HP, Strength, and Defense--that can all be boosted, and the max HP you can have is 40. Combat is fast, fluid, and always intense; just as it should be. Not only that, later on in the game, you will be given the freedom to change into two separate forms that will grant you an entirely different set of abilities and powers: Freedan, a dark knight, and Shadow, the ultimate warrior born from the light of the Comet. Each character will learn unique skills that allow them to access new and expansive areas, and sometimes, it is absolutely vital in order to move on with the game. Also, there are these secret items in the game called Red Jewels, and there are 50 of them scattered all across the world. Collecting them and bringing them to the Jeweler Gem, a master of disguise in every area you visit, will grant you items, power ups, and even access to a secret dungeon. No matter where you turn, there's never a dull moment.

PRESENTATION: 10/10
Everything about this game is outstanding. Beautiful, even. From the development of each character to the unique and exciting areas you will travel to, this game will have you loving every single second of every minute you spend playing it. You'll travel the world, going to real-life locations like the Great Wall of China, the Ankor Wat, and even the Great Pyramids, in search of the Mystic Statues and any trace of your father. It's as if every single pixel used for the graphics of this game were given an untold amount of detail, and it shows tremendously well. The game isn't ridiculously difficult in any way, but it gradually gets more difficult as you get closer towards the end, just like any good game should do. It also retains the world map system that Soul Blazer did, being that all destinations can be selected by simply choosing them on the world map itself. Everywhere you go, there's always something new to discover or something left to do, even if it feels like nothing at all. The adventure itself just seems endless, in every kind of good way imaginable.

MUSIC: 10/10
What can I say about this game's soundtrack that I haven't already said about any other game I've reviewed? Well, to put it simply, anything. I can't even put words into describing how amazing this game's music is. Every track, whether big or small, is moving, sensational, and at times, emotionally enticing. Of all the games I've played that had amazing soundtracks, this is the one I always find myself humming or whistling to when I'm at work, or when I'm out doing anything at all. It's atmospheric. It's intense. There are only a few tracks that are reused, and even when they do, you can forgive them for doing so because they're simply beautiful. Every area of every town, city, village, or dungeon will have you instantly hooked to the music playing in the background, and it's an addiction I will never overcome.

OVERALL RATING: 10/10
There are very few games that will ever score a perfect rating with me, but with Illusion of Gaia, I can honestly say, from the bottom of my heart, that a perfect score is what it deserves. All this time later, I still find myself popping the game in, playing it from start to finish without stopping. It's an outstanding game that deserves all the praise you have for it, and I think that, with this review, I have done it justice. Rated as my 3rd best game of all time, Illusion of Gaia is an excellent and enticing adventure that you will not want to miss!",THE ADVENTURE THAT STARTED IT ALL!!!,1370995200

Not that it's not good or anything, it's just not as good as I expected it would be. For one thing, it does not has a fasinating storyline as ac3 had. The players cannot interact with the world like what we did in ac3, we merely see the story unravels from two points of view, and the story is really way too simple. And the result is the game is really short, you can beat it under 10 hours if you have played its predecessor or you are an experienced gamer",dissapointed,1131321600
