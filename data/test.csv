After a few years use, instead of replacing the heads and/or battery again, I pick up the latest top of the line Norelco that's available. The Arcitec 1090 looked awesome, and I was looking forward to using it when I received it. What a disappointing product. Bottom line, it does not work nearly as well as my Quadra Action or SmartTouch XL models. I gave it some time thinking maybe my skin needed to adjust to it, but it has not improved.

You place one in your mouth on the gum line, outside of the tongue area, next to the aching tooth and leave in place for ten minutes. The instructions do not say to trim the plastic strip to fit, but in actual use, it was necessary to trim the strip in order to get the strip in place and have a comfortable fit for an aching  lower molar.

These worked very well, my son (30 years old, lives with me because he is disabled) had a tooth ache two weeks ago, we used one of these and his tooth hasn't bothered him since, but it was awkward to put in place, after one failed attempt of him trying to put a strip, we resorted to trimming the wide plastic strip before removing the backing and I put on a pair of disposable medical gloves and put the strip in for him.

44,5.0,False,"09 8, 2017",A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV,B00W259T7G,S.E. Poza,"This is an average-sized bar of scented French-milled, French-made soap designed to over a more luxurious experience than consumer-grade soaps. I will be comparing this both in use and in price to average body bars, but my rating takes into the account that this is a premium product which offers certain benefits that you cannot get from products like basic Ivory soap or Kirkland's body bar. This gets extra points for those added qualities.

I will note the price differences first. This is a 150-gram bar for a little under $5 whereas a 130-gram bar of Kirkland signature will cost you an average of 66 cents. Both bars will get you equally clean, but that is really the only point where the products overlap. Besides the truly lovely rose scent of this bar (it smells like a real rose  mild and not too overbearing, but present), it has a much better feel. The lather is creamier and feels silkier on the skin. One point about it that I was really happy about was that it wasn't so perfumey that I walked out of the shower smelling as if I'd applied a scent to my skin. This was more of an enjoyable transient experience in which I enjoyed the scent while I was using it, but didn't subject others to it once I was out of the bath. In my case, my husband is super sensitive to perfume-like smells so this worked for me. If you're looking for something longer lasting, this may not be what you're after.

In terms of how it leaves my skin, this is absolutely better for not drying my skin out. I'm guessing that this is the shea butter replenishing to some extent what oils the soap is stripping off when you use the soap. I wouldn't say that you don't need an added moisturizer after using it (at least I still needed moisturizer), but it's definitely gentler than other bars that I've used.

The bar is very hard or solid in a way that consumer-grade bars are not. This is because of the quad-milling that is advertised on the product page. I had not heard about this process before trying this soap, but it reduces the water content of the bars and makes them last longer. I will note that my average bar of soap will tend to melt in the shower and there are little stalactites of soap residue on my soap dish on my shower caddy where the soap has dissolved and the residue has drained off and hardened (which represents a loss of soap/value). This soap doesn't do that. It dries harder and firmer and doesn't melt away at the edges. That means that it lasts a lot longer. I can't do a scientific test or anything, but my best guess is that I got 3x the mileage out of this bar than the Kirkland bars that I usually use (and possibly 4x the use compared to Ivory, which I find melts away much more rapidly than any other soap). This is still a more expensive soap on average than consumer-grade brands, but it isn't quite as expensive as it seems when you factor in longevity and the quality of experience is rather markedly better in terms of the feel and the scent.","lasts longer than mass-mproduced consumer soaps, natural scent",1504828800

This enables him to get a smooth feeling on the skin without stripping and irritating it, and no creams and products are needed. The 3 rotating heads really adjust to the contour of the face and they snap open for easy clean up with water. I've seen him use it and it's a cinch, fast, easy and no mess!

Overall this is a great product, it works well and the face feels and looks good afterwards and it takes very little time to use. Better than shaving when it comes to comfort but my man still prefers the razor when he has to shave for work. This makes a great holiday gift, a gadget that people wouldn't run out and buy for themselves necessarily and fun to have as an option in the morning.

The clothes also usually smelled of the fresh outside as we hung our clothes on a line. She would let me spray and iron the hankies and pillow cases. To this day the scent of lavender brings back such happy memories.

The Pre De Provence lavender spray smells fabulous. Not the least bit musty, which some lavender sprays can get a bit of a musty undertone, not this one. It's fresh and clean and brightens the entire room. I iron clothes inside out if I'm going to use any spray, and a light spritz left a wonderful fragrance, not overwhelming, and didn't stain my clothes. I would suggest trying a small out of the way place first.

The spray is also good for just refreshing laundry. Getting out winter clothes from storage that are perfectly clean but could just a use a little pick me up after storage.

also very nice spritzed lightly on the bed a half hour or so before going to bed leaves a clean, lavender sleep experience.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.

So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.

1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.
2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.
3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.
4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).
5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.
6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!",1515974400

I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that lets you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle.

I love all three, but never was able to develop the skill to free hand camouflage patterns reliably with my Krome.  After seeing several youtube wideos, I decided to try the Badger Sotar 2020-2F when it was available on Amazon for a price ($69.89) less than I had paid for either of my Patriots or my Krome.  As soon as I took it out of the box, I was hooked.  It is much lighter and shorter than my Krome and feels like a pen in my hands and, just like  a pen, I was easily able to sketch in patterns.  After about 20 minutes of practice, I took on a three color schemed Syrian T-55 which turned out perfectly.  I was amazed and very pleased.  The lighter weight and the shorter nose of the Sotar compared to my Krome allowed me to use the full potential this fine instrument offered.  The trigger movement is silky smooth and the small cup is perfect for what I need it to hold.  The needle is very sharp and I would recommend using the included forked spray regulator to protect it from getting too close to the model surface.  For protection, I also store my Sotar with the needle slightly retracted; a piece of cake with the ability to loosen the chuck and pull the needle back from the rear  without removing the handle.  It cleans as easily as my Patriots or my Krome.

My only quibbles are the relatively flimsy carboard box that it comes in compared to the standard Badger hard plastic clamshell and the shorter nose may not fit most cleaning pots / airbrush holders so you may need to add an airbrush holder to your work top.  Fortunately, the gravity feed airbrush holder on my Badger TC 910 compressor works fine.

I highly recommend the Sotar 2020-F to any scale modeller looking for a superb detail airbrush at a stunningly low price.",Makes it easy to look like a pro!,1376179200

The ink flows extremely smooth and comes out heavily enough that it almost feels like you're painting.  (However, they don't randomly spit out blobs or anything.)  They are bright colors but have a slight translucence that helps with the ""glaze"" appearance.  Thus, they look good on top of markers (and will look a little different over different colors) and they look great alone.  I've been using them in Angie Grace coloring books (detailed mandalas/patterns) and am loving the results!  They do take a little time to dry, so you'll have to be careful.

**Edit 1** March, 2014 OK I opened this test light an used it for the first time.  I am a little disappointed at the LED lights that are now standard instead of the incandescent light bulb for two reasons .  First: there are 3 small blue LED's inside. With an incandescent test light it is possible to get a rough idea if there is strong battery power in the wire you are probing due to the intensity of the light.  Secondly, I often use a test light to test trailer brake control output.  These brake controls require a small draw before they will ""wake up"" and realize a trailer is connected (or, in reality just a test light). This LED test light prevents both of these uses.  I will see if I can use the incandescent bulb from one of my old THE 121 testers.  I still really like the design of this light and will probably continue to buy them and I'm aware that everything is slowly converting to LED lights.
** EDIT 2** June 2015 I have been buying the ""Camco 63928 Quickee"" tester.  It is comparable in quality to the original Wirehawk test light and uses an incandescent bulb.  The THE121 tester appears to sometimes have LED and sometimes be incandescent.  The price is higher for the Camco, but I think it is worth it to have the incandescent bulb.
**EDIT 3** November 2017 I bought this light again last week and am pleased to report that it has an incandescent bulb instead of the LEDs.  The price is half of what the Camco model sells for.

The many criticisms you've heard about the book's disjointed nature are true.  I keenly felt the absence of prior characters.  In addition, the author's difficulty in writing the book comes through.

It took Martin more than five years to write this book, and it's obvious to me.  He doesn't know where he wants to take us. I was often struck by how I had to press on - which was a sharp contrast with the prior volumes where sleep was a nuisance since it kept me from reading.

The kindest thing that I can say about many of the chapters of this volume is that they may be necessary to get to where the author ultimately wants to take us, and though tedious, are a necessary evil.  The worst that I can say is that the author may be milking the story for money.

By way of explanation for the redacted version of the story, Martin writes, ""I felt that the readers would be better served by a book that told all the story for half the characters, rather than half the story for all the characters.""  He further consoles that ""there's more to come. [We can expect a]nother book as big as this one.""  That's cold comfort to me since this was the shortest of the four books.  Furthermore, the idea that book HAD to be split is preposterous.  Lengthy books are published all of the time.  The idea that it is being done for our, the readers, benefit is insulting to our intellect. This book is a money grab.

The author and publishers made the conscious decision to double their profits, by splitting the book in two.  I was prepared to give this a pass, but the story suffers for it and the difficulty Martin faces of where to take the story next is exasperated by it.

Also, the only characters that appear from the previous history are Arya, Jamie, Sam and Sansa. The rest are new perspectives (though they may not be new characters, e.g., Cersei).  The new perspectives, in large part, are necessary to give the reader an understanding of what is happening in different parts of the realm, but it has the unfortunate effect of bloating a once-concise and riveting series into a meandering mess.  This is not to say that whole series is ruined by FEAST, but that with this addition the series has taken a noticeable departure from what preceded it.

All told, this book falls far short of the greatness of the previous three.  I recommend - since you will certainly read it at this point - that you wait for paperback.

P.S. - Please Mr. Martin, let's have no more comparisons between how long it took you and how long it took Tolkien to finish his work.  Tolkien's work at least delivered the goods after the wait.  You have compromised your ""art"" for money.  Classy.",A great money-grab . . .,1134259200

205,1.0,False,"12 28, 2012",A11CLC8C0F0L7M,0002247437,Thomas M. Slover,"I first came upon this series on TV.  Someone lent me the first season with high praise.  It was really good!  High production values, good actors, anxious wait for the next episode, etc. Not really like a run-of-the-mill TV series at all. Not having access to HBO, I figured I'd give the books a try.  The first one, A Game of Thrones, was pretty much like the first TV series.  Swell, I thought, I'll continue on.  About Book Three, I began to smell a rat.  The descriptions got longer and more pointless, characters weren't really developing, just appearing and sort of wandering around, and what I assumed to be the plot trajectory slowed way down and began to be too discursive and irresolute.  Then I read a cover blurb about George Martin.  Rather than being ""The American Tolkien"" (please, people), he was actually a TV writer himself, who worked on ""Beauty and the Beast,"" among others.  OK, a fantasy background, but still a TV fantasy background.  I had an acquaintance who worked in a TV show, and her goal was for the show to stay on the air for at least seven seasons.  After seven seasons, with residuals for reruns, she felt she could retire.  She was an actor, so I don't know how writers are paid, but the seven-season goal was definite.  She was working in TV around the time this guy Martin was, so I'm sure he's aware of this protocol.

Now, let's stop and think about how series TV is structured.  In the first episode, often a two-hour movie, the scene is set, the characters are introduced, in an often-gripping story, which certainly makes you want to tune in next week for more.  Unfortunately, many TV series never get better than their introductory episodes.  Characters are developed slowly, with new quirks introduced every few weeks, until you feel you know them and welcome them into your living room every week like old friends (that's the hope, anyway).  Difficulties are overcome (usually crimes are solved, bad guys demolished, etc.) in a story arc that takes one episode.  All done in the usual ways by the usual characters, with a few new ones to move the story along who disappear at the end of the episode.  So far, so good.

But wait, these books don't seem to have resolutions.  Okay, you say, maybe it takes more than one book to finish a really big, complicated story arc. So far, there's five books.  The reviews I've read of the fifth book seem to promise more of the same:  glacial story progress padded out with smaller and smaller events occurring to the main characters, plus a few extras who come and go.  Characters seem to devolve rather than evolve (esp. the female ones), and their little adventures seem to get more and more insignificant.  You start to get the feeling that you could pick up the next book without having read the one before it and pretty much catch up on the plot after reading just a little bit.  Folks, this isn't even series TV, it's soap opera.  Think about it:  Those things can last forever.  The same characters, or dynastic lines, continue on and on, with very few changes.  They react to the next phone call, bit of gossip, wedding, funeral, etc., in their customary ways, which, as devotees of this soap or that, you've come to know and love. Things happen, but nothing changes, and the whole juggernaut goes on and on and on, seemingly forever.  Thus is Song of Ice and Fire, but with swords, gore and nudity (a no-go on daytime TV).

I'm definitely quitting after this book, but for those of you who like the soap-opera form, knock yourselves out.  But please, folks, let's get real. This isn't Dickens, it isn't Tolkien, it isn't even ""Hawaii 5-0.""  At best, it's ""Dynasty""; at worst, it's ""General Hospital.""

This book may be an example of this cliche, as it is a jump start on a particular area of technology that is the subject of intense research at the present time: nanotechnology. There is talk about the possibility of self-replicating nanoscale robots, and with also the possibility that these entities could be intelligent, many individuals, scientists and non-scientists alike, feel apprehensive about this technology. The technology is not yet here, but developments in the 21st century are accelerating at an unprecedented rate.
 The book starts off well, at least after the introduction, which the author has felt the need to insert. The presence of the introduction is a distraction from the story line, at least for me personally, for I want to start the story without any biases or prejudices. The author's opinions in the introduction are somewhat negative about the future and character of humankind. A reader disagreeing with the author's opinions may be tempted to read the book with a hostile frame of mind. The author therefore should have kept his opinions to himself, and have spoken them through the characters in the book. He is clearly very worried about the developments in nanotechnology, and does not trust the scientific community to deal with it responsibly. The author though is bound by the constraint of making the story interesting, and that is hard to do without interjecting a large degree of malevolence in the technologies he is using in his story. Friendly, helpful nanobots are not going to hold anyone's attention for long.
 The first 150 pages or so of the book were very exhilirating: the tension building in the mind of Jack, the main character, and his doubts regarding his wife's behavior kept my attention. The author does a fine job of capturing his introspection, and in the meantime the reader gets a kind of crash introduction to terminology of evolutionary algorithms and artificial intelligence. Indeed, the reader gets exposed to talk of distributed parallel processing, or ""agent-based programs"", artificial life, ant routing, genetic algorithms, and protein folding, to name a few.
 As soon as Jack enters the desert though, the story gets less credible. Since this book has only been released for a few weeks, I could only say why I believe this by revealing the plot, which I don't want to do for the sake of new readers. I was surprised actually that the author took the move he did, as I was expecting the behavior of the nanobots to be much more subtle, as well as their detection. Instead though their behavior was very extreme, and this led me to think of how easy they would be to combat. The behavior of the nanobots would be much more believable if they would have acted in more mischevious ways, and such behavior would follow I think more naturally from the first part of the book.
  As the story nears its end, the events become more and more unbelievable. In addition, the characters seem to be almost juvenile in their behavior, and the author has the annoying habit of having them constantly using the ""F-word"". This is supposed to (I guess) make them more realistic, but instead they come across like they are playing nothing more than a difficult video game. In addition, obvious countermeasures to the nano-swarms make the story less believable. One could for example program a collection of swarms to engage in battle with the malevolent ones.
 Hence in general this is a disappointing book, which again is too bad considering the first part, which was written very well. I did not walk away with a feeling of foreboding that I did when reading the author's ""Andromeda Strain"" way back when. And if the book was meant to frighten the reader about the perils of nanotechnology, it missed its mark, considerably. But even if it did succeed in instilling fear about the possibility of nanotechnology, the research in this area will continue, and hopefully will be realized very soon.","Well, the first part was really good",1040342400

The characters weren't fleshed out fully enough and the ending was weak.  As someone stated earlier, I found it hard to care that the  killer turned out to be the silent police officer.  We don't know him well  enough to be really shocked.  And why do Alex and Kate have to go their  separate ways?  The book seems to endorse this idea that the two must  remain in their self-enforced isolation, but for no apparent reason.  The  only reason seems to be so that Alex Cross can go on another adventure  without any attachments from a previous novel.
The killers themselves  were just plain cheesy, even when we ""see through their eyes.""  Their motivations and drives are never satisfactorily elaborated.  Throughout the novel they are described as virile, intelligent, handsome,  athletic men.  But the cop seems a far cry from these descriptions,  silently belligerent and glowering.  And the killings seem to begin through  repressed sexuality, a desire for a woman that can never be realized  because of social inadequacy.  But then how can the killers be so smooth  and attractive at a later date?  I want more from a novel.  Not that I want  it explicitly explained, but give me some insights.

It's significant that he published those initial books in a four-year period.  In the eleven years since then, he has completed two books, both of which were disappointments to many readers.

The previous installment, A FEAST FOR CROWS, improved on a second reading.  Except for the sequences with Brienne, AFFC had brisk pacing and plenty of plot.

ADWD is much longer, and feels really, really long.  I got about halfway through and felt like nothing had really happened.  With the first three books, I couldn't put them down.  I took time off work and read for hours at a time, unable to break away and get interested in anything else.

With ADWD, by contrast, I actually starting looking forward to finishing it.  I was constantly flipping ahead to see how many pages were left in the chapter I was reading, and came very close to skimming in several places.  By the end, I wanted more, but that's because the story was finally getting exciting, and I knew I'd be left hanging.

There is just too much detail, too many incidental characters, and no real sense of events coming together.  It's more a collection of linked vignettes than a novel.  Martin is casting his net too wide; many of the subsidiary characters would be better dealt with in a series of short stories that could be published separately.  Dorne, the Ironborn, and Brienne would be good candidates for this treatment.

However, Martin wants to include everything, and this more than anything else probably accounts for the long time it's taken him to get this far.  He has so many balls in the air that it's difficult to focus.  This book is a vast, sprawling, out-of-control mess that needs a good editor.  I half-expected to see a POV chapter entitled:  ""THE KITCHEN SINK"".

Hopefully, if he's able to regain control of his material, he'll be able to finish the next book before Doomsday, and he can start bringing the disparate threads of the plot together.","Martin writes much and more, achieves little and less",1311984000

However, although the core of the story is intriguing and the writing itself is good, the author spins off in many different directions and weighs down the book with excessive verbiage, which caused me to severely lose interest.

Marlay,"After `Alive' broke them commercially with the smash hit anthem, `Rock and Roll All Nite', expectations would, I imagine, have been extremely high. So what better idea than to team up with the stratospherically successful producer of another theatrical rock act for their next studio album? It was clearly a master stroke. Bob Ezrin was behind the ongoing success of Alice Cooper (`School's Out', `Billion Dollar Babies', `Welcome To My Nightmare') and he delivered wholesale with `Destroyer', both wiping the band's earlier albums off the map and setting a creative benchmark that they would never ever reach again.

`Destroyer' is an epic - darker, more energetic, more theatrical, beautifully crafted, cleverly written and grand at every turn - a soaring hard rock musical vision that befitted and delivered on the physical image and stage show the band had created for themselves. Though it sports radio play introductions, strings and choirs on various tracks, these features are never allowed to overwhelm the group, ensuring that the end product is whole-heartedly hard rock. It has the feel of a concept album, but it isn't.

Beginning with a news report about a youth killed in a head-on collision against what sounds like the crash scene, complete with Kiss playing on the car radio, `Detroit Rock City' is the dramatic opener which literally crashes into `King of the Night Time World' followed by the cacophonous `God of Thunder'. Elsewhere a children's choir embellishes Gene Simmons on `Great Expectations' and a string section backs Peter Criss on the band's first and best ballad, `Beth'.

One of the album's great strengths is the creative involvement of the entire band. Again Paul Stanley's fingerprints are all over it, writing or co-writing 6 of the 9 songs. Gene Simmons even sings Stanley's `God of Thunder' completely making it his own, and writes or co-writes 4 of the other songs. `Flaming Youth' sounds like Ace Frehley had a heavy hand in it as co-writer and Bob Ezrin's compositional involvement in 7 of the 9 tracks clearly elevates the material. Though Kiss would resort unsuccessfully to trying to emulate the success of `Rock and Roll All Nite' throughout their career, the anthemic `Flaming Youth' and `Shout It Out Loud' never feel like poor cousins to that hit, nor are they remotely corny (the trap of later attempts). In fact there is not a weak moment on this album. It is quite literally a masterpiece. And the 1997 remaster sounds fantastic.",Their soaring magnum opus,1309046400

From there to 1969 they would add 22 more. And here you get all but one of them.

The completist side of me wanted to deduct one star for the omission of I'm Gonna Hold On As Long As I Can [# 76 Hot 100 in January 1969], but in the end I gave in to an otherwise fantastic CD and assigned the full 5. Non-hits included here are track 3, the flip of their first hit, and Too Strong To Be Strung Along. which backed Strange I Know [# 10 R&B/# 49 Hot 100 in early 1963]. The flipside of Beechwood 4-5789 [# 7 R&B/# 17 Hot 100 in 1962], Someday, Someway [track 5] reached # 8 on the R&B charts.

Original members, when they were a quintet, included Gladys Horton, Georgeanna Marie Tillman Gordon, Wanda Young, Katherine Anderson, and Juanita Cowart. Both Horton and Young took turns singing lead. Gordon, who left in 1965, died from lupus on January 6, 1980.

The setting was ripe for such exploration:  This was shot during the crucial period when Metallica, then known as one of the most uncompromising bands in music, was first paired up with ace producer Bob Rock, known both for his crystalline productions and his rock-hard stubbornness.  The ensuing conflict among band members and producer makes for endlessly fascinating viewing.  Part 1 exhaustively explores every aspect of recording Metallica's eponymous 'Black Album' (obviously, you'll get much more out of this documentary if you know the album well).  Highlights include Kirk Hammett's frustrating search for a solo to ""The Unforgiven""; the battle between a sore-throated James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich; and a vocal session where you become intensely aware of just how much editing is required to put together one perfect lead vocal take.  If you love music but have never immersed in this process, it's extremely illuminating -- it points out to you how the music comes into being.  Plus you get three videos -- the casual studio-performance piece ""Nothing Else Matters""; ""The Unforgiven"", a beautifully photographed expressionistic piece under director Matt Mahurin's lyrical, languid treatment; and the classic ""Enter Sandman"", a manic romp which stands as director Wayne Isham's crowning achievement.

Part 2 is a little more for fans.  With its numerous live performances and less coherent structure, this part appeals more to longtime fans of Metallica who want to see how the band works when the scope of its fanbase suddenly increased tenfold.  There are still fascinating bits even for casual perusers:  The tensions between the Metallica/Guns N' Roses camps when the two bands joined up for a massive, trouble-ridden tour; an after-show meeting where the Metallica members discuss changes and critique one another; and backstage footage from the Freddie Mercury tribute concert.  The two official videos, ""Sad but True"" and ""Wherever I May Roam"", are passable, with near-interchangeable footage and a distinct lack of character.

I used to put on my old VHS copy of Part 1 every couple of months just to delve into the terrific in-studio interactions of Bob Rock and Metallica.  The release of both volumes of this video on DVD was a pleasant surprise to me, and anybody who wants to know more about the process of being a professional musician (and star) should check this one out.  After seeing the amount of painstaking work put into each stage of the band's music, you might be less inclined to crucify Metallica for fighting against Napster.",One of the best music documentaries I've ever seen.,1082678400

First of all, I never knew that the Police had such a large collection of music videos.  Of course most people have seen ""Every Breath You Take"" and ""Wrapped Around Your Finger"" at sometime or another, but I had no idea they'd been making them as early as their debut album.  I'd say each one is very enjoyable and humorous in its own right (""Invisible Sun"" is the only video that the group intended to be very serious, in its portrayal of the British-Irish conflicts).  My personal favorite is ""So Lonely,"" which features the group walking around talking on handheld radios and Stuart Copeland irritating everyone by hitting every object he saw with his drumsticks.  Classic.

Also included are some session videos and interviews, entitled ""The Police in Monserrat.""  For the music performances, they just lip-synched and jumped around a recording studio to ""Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic,"" ""Demolition Man,"" ""One World (Not Three),"" and ""Spirits in the Material World.""  The interviews (which are interspersed between the studio videos) are easily the best selections on the entire DVD.  All three members of the band are interviewed separately during the ""Ghost in the Machine"" era sessions and explain some of their writing, recording, and playing techniques that they've employed in the album and in their music as a whole.  Copeland, Summers, and Sting are all absolutely fantastic musicians and these interviews bring their individiual originalities and geniuses to light in a very introspective light.

My only complaint about the DVD is that there aren't nearly enough live performances.  Included are only two from the same British show called the Old Grey Whistle, which are ""Can't Stand Losing You"" and ""Next to You.""  I hope to watch them reunited in concert one day.

Finally, the DVD contains ""Studies in Synchronicity,"" which is an interesting video short featuring musical bits from the Synchronicity album, and a discography.  This collection was easily one of the best DVD/musical investments I've made in a long time.

Having enjoyed those two CDs, I decide to further immerse myself in the John Martyn experience and buy this double disc compilation.

There's only the slightest snippets of folk weaved in there too, but don't go thinking like this guy is another Nick Drake. Not at all. Some of the music on the second disc, the stuff that veers into the so-called ambient category, reminds me a bit of Durutti Column. In other words, very interesting. John Martyn was seemingly not content to confine his compositions to one style, so perhaps that eclectic nature did not help his album sales. But it does make one appreciate his music all the more. Some simply outstanding music to be found on this collection. I can't say that I love all of it, but most of it is certainly very, very good.

But now it's my 2nd favourite on this album, after Sweet Child o'Mine.  All the songs apart from tracks 8 ,5 and 11 are 5*.  Until I bought Iron Maiden, Number of the Beast (the album I bought after this), it was by far my favourite.

The best songs on this album are Welcome to the Jungle, Sweet Child o mine, Paradise City and Nightrain, in my view.  I have given a closer look at all the songs below.

1.  Welcome to the Jungle. 5*.  This song kicks off the album really well- with a slightly slow intro, then into real GNR style, energetic riff.

2.  It's so Easy. 5*.  I like this song.  Axl starts off by singing in a deep voice, most of the way, then he goes higher towards the end, accompanied by Slash's awesome guitar.

3. Nightrain. 5*  One of my all time Heavy Metal favourites.  This song is REALLY effective, and i love it.  A great load of guitar skills applied by the guitar master Slash.

4.  Out ta Get me.  5*.  I really like this song too.  Axl has some really strong vocals here, Slash has some great guitar playing. Duff, one of the worlds most underrated bassists, has some great bass here too.

5.  Mr Brownstone. 4*.  A bit of a disappointement compared with the rest of the album.

6.  Paradise City. 5*  This is INCREDIBLE.  My 3rd fav. on the album, this song has all the heavy metal charachteristics.  Its amazing.

7.  My Michelle. 5*. Starting off acoustically- then getting real heavy metal style.  THe hardest on the album.. Potentially the best, too.

8. Think about you. 3*  I shall say no more.  By far the poorest on the album.  I'd scratch the bottom of this CD badly to get rid of this song.

9.  Sweet Child o mine.  5*.  Far and Away my favourite GNR song.  It's incredible!  The least agressive on the album, this solo is my all time favourite.  Get it just for this.

10.  Your Crazy.  5*  On the whole a good song.  Possibly A BIT fast, otherwise, very good.

11. Anything goes 4*. The basics for a good song, possibly just not applied properly.

12.  Rocket Queen.  5* This one is an excellent album ender.  Leaving the listener on a high, the last part is extremely well done, well linked from the first part.  Some incredible guitar in this song.  Well worth 5*, and one of the greatest album enders ever.

Well- I've nothing more to say. If you want to enjoy an album, with energetic songs and no regrets, then get this now!

They've messed with a few different sounds over the years, from near-pop to hard rock, but this, their first release, is 100% pure southern-fried-stompin' good. Not only are they one of the best Christian bands in circulation; they're one of the best southern-rock bands I've ever heard. There isn't a song on this album I'd dare to skip. Not only that; as with all of their other songs, there's enlightenment and storytelling savoir-faire from start to finish. There's a lesson in each song, as Mac Powell waxes poetic about the lengths one would go to for pure love ('Just To Be with You') and the crucifixion (from one of the thieves' point of view...very stirring) ('Who Is This Man'). Third Day also takes a jab at secular music (namely, the Black Crowes) on 'Black Bird', one of my personal faves. They even take it up a notch and sprinkle the song with titles from early Black Crowes tunes. Clev-ver! The true southern-fried grit is in their straight-up praise songs; it always has been. The last track is the best example, with easy lyrics to pick up and sing along with, and it's one of the most memorable on any of their albums (mostly because of the happily jingling instruments in the background).

If you prefer the Rod Stewart of the 1980s, ""Blondes Have More Fun"" and all, this might not be your thing. Teenagers will generally look bewildered if you play them this kind of music, and look at you like you're from another planet if you profess to enjoy it.

Tough, organic folk, gritty blues, swaggering rock, and melodic country blended together and stirred with a drumstick...and, to me, ""Gasoline Alley"" is the best of the lot, alongside ""Every Picture Tells a Story"".

Now if you ask me, and plenty of folk interested in domesticated livestock and modern pop music do now and again, Ram could have easily been called ""Ewe"" and it would have been just as good.  This one came out in 1971 and was just as much a Linda album as it was a Paul album.

A lot of folks have been critical of the late Linda Eastman McCartney because of her obvious lack of musical skills. I believed for many years that the keys on here keyboard had been color coded so when she performed with Wings she could just use her index fingers to push the appropriate color-coded keys in time with the music. Red, blue, red, red, blue, yellow, green, red, etc. Turns out that might have been true at the start, but Paul got a considerable amount of inspiration from his musically challanged spouse and I reckon his overabundance of talent made up for any deficit she might have brought to the equation.

I recall a bunch of the same folks who were all enthralled with the ""Paul is Dead"" urban legend during the Beatles era shifting their fascination to the open feud betwixt Paul and John in their solo work. The ""Too Many People"" was the first shot across the bow from HMS McCartney and prompted John to come out with his oh-so bitter anti-Paul rant ""How Do You Sleep?"" on the album Imagine.

Unlike his first solo effort, this one had a bunch of singles taken from it. The first was ""Too Many People"", followed by ""Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey"". On the right shore of the Atlantic they had ""Heart Of The Country"" and ""The Back Seat Of My Car"" thrown at them as singles. I reckon all four tunes are pretty good and that accounts for part of the reason why this here album was on the charts for 37 weeks and managed to stay at the #2 spot for two weeks.

Others come for a brief moment and leave afterwards never to be heard from again. The Cranberries can fall in both categories depending on what your point of view is on the 90's rock music scene or just this particular Irish band. One thing is for sure, ""No Need To Argue"" is a timeless work of art. The album mixes rock 'n roll with a nice cozy sentimental feel that would make any person weep. The album is brilliant really and I would have to be a biased reviewer here and say that I judge this album on my personal account on what it means to me personally. In other words, I love this album.
From the beautiful hum and sing along tune 'Ode To My Family', to the deeply moving '21', 'The Icicle Melts', and 'Disappointment', the albums carries you along a flow of groundbreaking songs one track after another. To be honest, there isn't a bad track on 'No Need To Argue' even if I tried to find one. The music, the singing, and the lyrics all shape up together beautifully to form a masterpiece. Standout tracks, however, are 'Zombie' which remains to be one of The Cranberries most famous songs and one of the best songs written in the 90's; 'Ridiculous Thoughts' is the most haunting track on the album that plays with your ears and your senses for as long as it is, and its Dolores O Riordan's vocals that makes this song as well as all others an exciting listening; 'Dreaming My Dreams' is a beautiful love ballad and so is 'I Can't Be With You',; 'Ode To My Family' is as the titles states a beautiful ode to the closest people in your life.
Since 1994, when this album was released, The Cranberries have failed to equal the power and originality of 'No Need To Argue' They probably won't ever even if they tried to but who would need to prove himself after giving an excellent example of what a music album should sound like?

Its heft and quality are obvious, as are the stainless screws holding it together.  I like that.  What I didn't like is when I mounted it in the CD slot, my player has a detachable face, and it kept coming off.  Also, sometimes it tricked the unit into thinking a cd was stuck or partially in and it gave an error message.  SO- if listening to radio (cannot use CD if this is in it) it would change to cd and not play anything.  It also says in the instructions you can stick it in a slot or space---I found one between some sections of the dash, but they were cosmetic and it didn't hold it well.  The face of the dash (fake wood, lol) snapped off, as this put leverage on the edge just as a pry tool would.  IF your car is designed with a factory CD, non detachable, this will probably work well.  The edge doesn't go in far enough to engage the player, so you don't have to worry about damage, but it does go in about 1/2 inch and that was enough to undo my faceplate, and intermittently trick it into thinking a cd was inserted.  IF you can get past that--its awesome.  OR if your car is older with a metal dash or places where there is a 1/8"" space between say the radio or glove box, etc, ash tray, whatever, it will work and work well.  I must warn you that with the gps or phone in the holder, it blocks the radio dial, and or AC switch etc, depending on where its mounted.  As I say, its not without flaws but neither is a GPS mount stuck in the middle of your windshield.  This is just a way to move the ---not perfect--situation to another place, and you deciding what is the lesser of two evils so to speak.  For me, it was the windshield --but that has more to do with the design of my car and stereo and less to do with me personally  Good luck----its a great idea and worth every penny.","Excellent idea, extremely well made",1411084800

There are two versions of the Sanyo eneloop 4-cell charger available in the US (see my Customer Image on how to identify them). This package includes the MQN06. It forces you to charge cells in pairs (either 2 or 4), so it is very inconvenient if you have application that requires odd number of cells. Be careful not to charge a half-full cell in pair with an empty cell, because the first cell will end up over-charged, which is bad for its lifespan.

The MQN05 included in the other package is a slightly better charger, because it charges each cell individually. Unfortunately it only works with US voltage of 110V AC. So you must be careful not to use it in foreign countries with 220V AC.

If you need a compact travel charger that can do both (charges cells individually, and accepts universal voltage), I highly recommend either the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/KODAK-1-Hour-Battery-Charger-K6200/dp/B000WMIF8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">KODAK 1-Hour Battery Charger K6200</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Duracell-Mobile-Charger-CEF23DX4N/dp/B000XSA5WW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Duracell Mobile Charger CEF23DX4N</a>.

I noticed that this product page now shows an eneloop power pack in blister package, while the one I originally reviewed was in a blue plastic storage case. The contents are slightly different. It now contains 8 AA and only 2 (not 4) AAA eneloop cells. Also Sanyo seems to have phased out the MQN05 charger (the one that charges individually) and replaced it with MQN06 (charges in pairs only) in all eneloop packages. So please exercise caution when ordering this or similar products.

 Traded mine for a Samsung i500 and am much happier except for the lack of after-market add-ons or lack of stock. Samsung is tri-band so this is great for additional use in other areas where there is no PCS service. Samsung has voicedial and speed dials that exceed that of the Treo and I like that better. Size of Samsung i500 is much smaller and fits in my pocket easier, as I an not a man with large pockets. The fact that I can not play MP3s due to the limited memory of the Samsung vs. the Treo is not an issue as I have an Ipod. Ripping MP3s and slow load make the Treo not a great music player.

The case/pouch with the phone in it, fits comfortably in pants pockets.  Also, the thickness of this case/pouch will allow for even a little bulkier TPU case such as those with a built in kick stand.  This case/pouch provides the extra protection needed from drops etc., needed when mobile.  UPDATE I am adding to this review (no change in rating).  If the back metal clip is not desired (some may and some may not like the metal clip), the metal clip can be easily but permanently removed by cutting the threads that attach it to the back band (I used a single edge razor blade to do this and it left no marring or holes in the fabric of the case/pouch).  This results in the case/pouch being slimmer, more easier to handle and lay down and more comfortable when placed in the pants pocket.  By just removing the metal clip and the fabric it is attached to (the D ring will be removed to), but leaving the back fabric band alone, the case/pouch can still be worn horizontal on a belt if so desired (belt looped through the back fabric band).",Perfect For Galaxy Note 2,1358467200

430,5.0,False,"05 1, 2012",A2582KMXLK2P06,B00138KN0A,Bryan,"Super Sessions is a pretty unique album.  First of all I went into the album having very little experience with Mike Bloomfield despite numerous reviews convincing me of the genius and spectacular beauty of Bloomfield's guitar style.  Well guess what?  I DO love the mans style!  It takes a while to warm up to it however, and this is mainly because he plays at such an intense speed that there's hardly any time to catch your breath!  You need to hear it several times in a row to absorb and understand it!

Now when I first heard ""Albert's Shuffle"" a thought occured to me... ""MOVE over Eric Clapton!"" because it sounds almost identical to some of Clapton's heavy blues stuff such as the live version of ""Have You Ever Loved a Woman?"" from his EC Was Here live album.  It definitely falls under the same category of emotionally resonant blues, but regardless who influenced who (though I think Clapton beat him to the punch but I could be wrong, hehe) this song is downright amazing.  Amazing how the guitar solos build through several layers of emotions and THEN to add more excitement, a keyboard solo makes an appearance around the halfway point, and it's a highly melodic keyboard solo at that.  It's an interesting change of pace going from emotional guitar solos to melodic keyboard work.  Perhaps the light touch of jazz after the keyboard solo is a bit much, but then again, this IS 1968 and considering this is what I believe the beginning of the classic years of rock, it's quite a performance.  There's definitely nothing lacking or incomplete about this album overall, that's for sure.  ""Really"" falls under the same category- emotional guitar playing, melodic keyboard solos, jazzy tendencies, etc.  Another high point.

I absolutely LOVE ""His Holy Modal Majesty"".  In fact I actually first heard this song a few years ago on XM radio.  What caught my attention is the bass groove that can be heard during the first couple minutes, and... I had to do a google search to find THIS out, but the musical instrument jamming with the groove is something called an ondioline.  Don't even ASK me how to pronounce that, haha.  It's a high pitched instrument that's somewhere in between an early synthesizer and a keyboard.  Well whatever it is, it would probably irritate the pants off of me if it were to linger a few minutes longer BUT for just a couple minutes?  I can tolerate a couple minutes of a weird instrument!  Heck I can tolerate extreme pain for 2 minutes!  Well then again I've never been tortured.  Don't get any ideas!  :)

Anyway, that bass groove is... WOW!  It makes ""His Holy Modal Majesty"" the best song on the album for me.  It reminds me of something kinky or rather, an Egyptian girl being kinky, hehe.  The rest of the song is occupied with fast-paced blues solos that are pretty melodic for the most part.

""Season of the Witch"" is the highlight for many people since it's the most familiar song here.  Well truth be told I never thought it was *that* great of a song- a slow-chugging, slightly ominous vocal melody that actually reminds me of Neil Young's ""Down By The River"" for some reason, and the jazziness we eventually experience is... eh, a bit much.  Not a bad song by any means, and this is by FAR the best version of it too.  11 minutes is just too much for my limited attention span I'm afraid!  Though it IS really melodic so at least it has that going for it.  ""Stop"" is based around really cool, melodic blues guitar and keyboard soloing.  Once again, the keyboard work strikes me as immediatley melodic whereas the guitar solos are a bit on the complex side so it takes time to search for the melodic lines.  It's awesome though.  ""Harvey's Tune"" is an atmospheric jazz instrumental.  I love it.

""Man's Temptation"" is a soulful tune with really beautiful and memorable vocals.  I love the creative inclusion of horns as well.  Yes there's hundreds of 60's songs that closely resemble this one in terms of atmosphere, arrangements and vocals but I don't care- I'll take them ALL!  ""You Don't Love Me"" is dominated with the ULTRA cool phase shifter effect.  You'll know what I mean when you hear it.  It sounds like you're in a spaceship and headed for Saturn!  I wonder if todays technology can recreate this particular sound?  I haven't heard this effect used in any music after the mid 70's.  It must have went out of style.  Anyway this is a blues/hard rock song similar to Robin Trower's early work, and it's awesome.  ""It Takes a Lot To Laugh, It Takes a Train To Cry"" reminds me of the mid 60's Byrds with a fast-paced, psychedelic part-country style.  Those feel good vibes are in high quantity here as well.

Overall, it's super duper Super Sessions!  Pick it up for a solid taste of Mike Bloomfield, Stephen Stills and Al Kooper (though for me Bloomfield CLEARLY steals the spotlight).",it's super alright!,1335830400

Among the hits included here are We both walk, Half enough, Good as I was to you, I guess you had to be there, Train wreck of emotion, Standing tall and Something in red.
Apart from the hits, this collection contains five new recordings. These include a live cover of Angel (a Sarah McLachlan song) and an excellent cover of Another lonely night, one of Tammy Wynette's less heralded classic songs. There is nobody better suited to singing Tammy's classics, as Lorrie has been divorced almost as often as Tammy. The other three new tracks are To get to you, If I cry and Whoop-de-do.
Lorrie, like me, has very eclectic musical tastes and it shows in her choice of material. Unfortunately, many people these days prefer singers to choose a particular style and stick to it. Because of that, Lorrie's determination to record a variety of material has limited her success. Unquestionably blessed with one of the finest voices in contemporary country music, Lorrie should be a bigger star than she actually is.
If you only want one collection of Lorrie's music, this is the one to choose. Many of the missing hits can be found on her CD in the RCA country legends series.

457,5.0,False,"01 12, 2010",A4JHEO7H330AF,B000001OL6,Tom Brody,"I have used Maxell XLII for over two decades.  I've used them on a Nakamichi 581 cassette deck, a Tandberg TCD320 cassette deck, and small hand-held recorders from Sony (with built-in microphone).

I've used the Maxell XLII tapes for recording albums from vinyl, recording from compact discs, and recording live, e.g., parties, waterfalls, and my own electric-guitar playing using a Nakamichi microphone.

When I first got my Nakamichi 581, I did a side-by-side test of an actual vinyl record, and my taped copy of the vinyl recording.  I was not able to tell the difference.  This demonstrates the high quality of the Maxell XLII tape.  The particular recording was a duet with Max Roach on drums and Anthony Braxton on saxophone.  This recording was an especial challenge to the tape's ability to record at higher frequencies.  The Maxell tape passed the test, so to speak.  Also, I recently listened to recordings that I made in the year 1980.  I have no reason to believe that the recordings on my Maxell tape have deteriorated.  This is another good thing about the Maxell XLII tape.

I have nothing bad to say about the 90 minute Maxell XLII tape.

But I do have bad things to say about tape recorders.  First of all, my Tandberg is a risky machine.  Perhaps, one time out of 100 times that I use the Tandberg, the tape gets tangled up.  I blame this on the Tandberg, not on the tape.  Another problem is that my Nakamichi 581 has been broken for many years, and I have not been able to find anybody who repairs this sort of machine.  The Nakamichi 581 was, and probably still is, the highest quality cassette deck known to mankind.  But I can't find anybody who can fix mine.  Again, this is not the fault of the tape.

Finally, Sony had an excellent little hand-held cassette player/recorder, the TCM-454VK.  The sound quality of this machine is fine for recording nature sounds and children's music concerts.  However, I dropped this Sony machine, and it broke, and it is not manufactured anymore.  Instead, Sony does make a similar, newer model, but the sound quality of this Sony cassette recorder is garbage (please see my reviews of the newer Sony machine).  But this is not the fault of the tape. Sony TCM-200DV Standard Cassette Voice Recorder adds a high-pitched whining sound to your tapes.  A similar recorder, the Panasonic RQ-L31 Portable Cassette Recorder with Slide Microphone, adds a high-pitched chirping sound to your tapes.

The following applies only to recording nature sounds, children's marching bands, and so on.  The following does not apply to making tape recordings from commercially available music on compact discs.

Last year, I bought a digital voice recorder, the Olympus DS-40.  Please see my review of the Olympus DS-40.  The Olympus DS-40 is an absolute dream and a miracle  -- because of the very low background noise, because of the absence of clicking sounds when starting/stopping or when pausing/restarting recordings, because of the extreme length of recordability, and because of its extremely compact size.  Therefore, at least for amateur recordings of nature sounds, marching bands, and parties, cassette tapes and cassette recorders might no longer be medium of choice.",These tapes have been my friend from 1980 to 2009.,1263254400

My parents have the Sony CDPCX355. The one down side to the Pioneer that the Sony has better is the CD text feature. With the Pioneer, I don't have a single CD where the ""CD text"" is read and displayed. The Sony does a much better job of reading and displaying the titles and artists from CDs. Also the Sony has a keyboard port so you can plug in a keyboard and edit disk information manually (a very nice feature). Also, the Sony's display has a seperate line for CD text where the Pioneer replaces track information with the text. Because of this (I assume) the Sony displays the CD's text much more quickly (the Pioneer's manual says its displays the text after 5 seconds).

Since I was in need, I paid full retail price. Couple of comments. You need to have an external flash and be able to do bounce lighting for this lens to be really useful inside. Its a slow lens as the aperature is small. This lens is what I would call an ""average"" lens. It does everything good but nothing great. The advantages of this lens is the great focal length capability. 28-200mm covers alot of ground. If you travel and you just want to keep memories for yourself and keep your film/digital camera at full auto or f/ 5.6 to 8, you will get great results. use a 580 or a 430 ex flash and that will help compensate for indoors. I think the focal lengths work better for full frame or film cameras over the small sensor digital cameras.

The thing about this lens is the greatest asset of the lens is also the greatest weakness. To be able to provide 28mm-200mm at 350-500 bucks, it requires alot of compromises. Its slow indoors or requires flash which for most people is okay. you will get softness if you blow pictures up past 8x10. Its heavy and long. It doesn't have a small depth of focus for your close ups, it needs to be on a tripod for 200mm unless you can hold it very steady and even then you will want a flash.

If you want a good all around lens under 400.00 this is your lens. If you want to spend a little more you get IS and USM with the 28-135mm. My feeling is, you take great pictures with a lens you have, not a lens you don't have. I think for begineers and for a fun day just shooting regular pictures, this is a great lens. Save the artsy pictures and the emotional pictures for a 50mm 1.4 or a 85mm 1.8 or a up close picture for the 70-200mm.

In the past I've spent between 30-40 for what I thought were pretty good camera bags.  But when I got it I immediately understood why.  It is a true workhorse, and it's HUGE.  The build quality is better than I've ever seen.  I feel like this bag could last my whole photographic career, and then be passed on to someone else.  I am shooting weddings lately, and being able to have all my gear (two Canon cameras, 4 lenses, 2 flashes, and a bunch of small things like cards and batteries) in one place, safely packed up, is very nice.  If you put everything inside in a way that makes sense to you, you can easily be in and out of this bag when you need to grab a new lens, change a card, etc, and go back to shooting.  The shoulder strap seems durable, though I'm sure they make a more comfortable one, but this isn't a bag you'll have on your back for too long.  If you fill it up, it will be HEAVY.  So the strap is just there for you to carry it to your location and work out of it.

If you have normal sized lenses (I guess I mean prime lenses 200mm or under and zooms that aren't your crazy 70-200 Canon L series zooms) on your cameras, you should be able to fit both of them in the bag WITH the lenses on.  If not (I for example do use a crazy 70-200 Canon lens sometimes), you will probably have to store your 2nd camera without a lens attached unless it is really small like the 50 f/1.4 or something.  This is unavoidable though, unless they made the bag twice as big, which would be much too big to carry around in my opinion.

If you are pro or semi-pro and wanting a great bag that protects your gear while giving you easy access on the job, I recommend you spend the extra money and get this awesome bag from Tamrac.  If you have less gear, maybe just one camera and a couple lenses, I'd definitely get a smaller bag, though still stick with Tamrac as they make the best bags on the market.",Ridiculously high quality.

Meadows,"When I originally purchased this monitor, there wasn't any information saying that you had to have a dual-link DVI capable graphics card. $125 later, I had one, which I shouldn't have had to buy. So there went any actual money savings out the window. Bought a GeForce GT640, which ran the monitor just fine.... for a while.

Next, I got maybe a year and a half of use and started having the EXTREMELY frustrating 'black screen only"". I can plug any other monitor into the graphics card and it will work just fine, but NOT this one. Then a few days later, it would start inexplicably working again. Then, black screen again. When you turn the monitor on, it will immediately go into a sleep mode (orange LED still lit indicating power to the monitor, but no display is shown on the monitor at all).

This is a VERY common problem with this monitor and seems to be that it has very crude communication with graphics cards, especially Nvidia based cards.

I've done both BIOS and Nvidia graphics card driver updates. Sometimes this gets it working again for a while, sometimes it doesn't, but it always, always, always glitches back out again.

That same graphics card will power a much larger television screen with no problems at all, so I'm convinced the problem isn't a hardware problem in the computer.

SECOND problem--- the power supply on this monitor is an abysmal piece of junk. The part that plugs into the monitor will wear out eventually (from seemingly doing nothing but sitting there with the cable plugged into it) and you'll find that it fits really loosely. It is NOT hard to bump the cord and yank the plug out.

The power supply itself will likely tank on you also. Mine started getting really hot and making a wheezy buzzing sound. Since I know how, I just bought a $40 benchtop power supply that is capable of running several of these monitors and spliced the old cable onto the new power supply. That works like a champ.

Lastly, the DVI plug on the back of the monitor is in a really inconvenient place. It's really hard to plug anything into it without laying the monitor flat. And you better screw it in very well, otherwise it's sure to fall out. Also, you have to bend the DVI cable a LOT to get it into place, which again is just poor design.

With the way it's designed it's very comfortable to use with both normal books and an e reader with a case.

Also works great with books, magazines, in the car, at the movies, basically also as a general flashlight.

If I could change one thing about this it would be the METAL clip. Which if your not careful can scratch anything your using, I've scratched my kindle, and majority of the books I've used with it. I order to fix this problem I wrapped the clip with electrical tape, and problem solved. If it wasn't for that little problem I'd give it 5 stars.

556,5.0,False,"09 9, 2011",A3SMR4HRFJARSC,B0000DBN2F,ChristineMM,"Tazo Iced Passion tea is an herbal blend not a true ""tea"", since it has no black tea, no green tea, or any other kind of real tea. It is technically an herbal tea with some additional ingredients added. It has hibiscus flowers, licorice, orange peel, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass plus it as added ""natural tropical flavors"", citric acid, and fruit juice extract for the very red color.

These are ""iced tea bags"" -- each bag is large and makes 2 quarts worth of iced tea. The directions indicate to boil 1 quart of water and to steep the bag for 5 minutes then to pour into another 1 quart of cold water to make the iced tea. This was easy to do.

I like sweet iced (traditional) tea and also I enjoy herbal teas and other plant infusions. I first tried this tea with sugar added as I assumed I would want it, but then tried it unsweetened and found the flavor fruity and almost sweet naturally, so now I drink it without added sugar. I would say it tastes sweet and fruity and almost like a more sophisticated version of a fruit punch drink that kids usually like.

Everyone is different and only you can determine if this is right for you...

My husband enjoys unsweetened iced tea and hot traditional teas unsweetened and he felt this unsweetened iced passion tea was too ""sweet"" and ""flowery"". My sons didn't like it as they are used to plain water (which is 99% of what my husband and I allow them to drink) or having their flavored drinks even more dense such as pure fruit juices or artificially flavored drinks or having sugar-filled sodas. My kids have learned to associate flavored drinks with more of oomph and more sweet than this unsweetened herbal ""tea"", unfortunately.

This also has a fantastic deep red color thanks to the added fruit juice extract.

I really enjoy this as an alternative to drinking plain water all day long. It is nice to have a flavorful cold drink that has zero calories, does not have unnatural ingredients, and has no artificial sweeteners (as diet sodas have). It is quite thirst-quenching too.

Drinking Tazo Iced Passion Tea also helps mask the flavor of city tap water which is good for when I am stuck with city water as my only water source.",Fruity and Flowery - Delicious Iced Drink - Thirst Quenching,1315526400

There is a significant difference between these UNWRAPPED TEA BAGS and the INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED TEA BAGS (or loose leaf tea sold in sealed bags and tins). I recently purchased some of each at the same time. These unwrapped bags had virtually no smoky aroma upon opening and lacked the smoky taste as well. The difference between these and the SEALED tea is night and day. You must buy one of the sealed versions if you want to be sure to get a smoky tasting tea (either wrapped bags OR sealed loose tea).

If you absolutely want to use bags rather than loose tea, you will need to spend extra for the individually wrapped bags if you want the true Lapsang Souchong experience. If you buy these loose bags, you will have to hope that you are lucky enough to get a package that was recently harvested and processed in order to get the same experience.

What I now do is keep about a week's worth of the loose leaf tea version in a Taylor's tin and the rest in an air-tight container. This way my tea is always fresh and has that wonderful smokiness that we Lapsong Souchong lovers drink (and smell) the tea for.

TIP: You only need to buy the tin version once. After that just buy the boxes of LOOSE TEA. Those boxes do contain the exact same foil wrapped package that the tins do. The tin is worth having because it looks great on display and although it is not air-tight, it does a decent job of keeping the tea fresh for a week or two.",-TIP-  Lapsang Souchong Lovers:,1417219200

This has got to be the best bread machine on the market.  With two kneading blades it mixes and kneads the dough perfectly without having to use a spatula to work the flour in.  The control panel is great because it tells you whether the dough is rising, baking, etc.  And since it preheats the ingredients you don't have to worry about whether the liquid is at the right temperature for the yeast to rise.

Of course, if you also sift flour frequently, that is not really convenient unless you buy a second sifter.  I didn't rate the sifter five stars because I find it to be slower than other sifters, and also messier.

I was using another rinse and decided to try Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse.  The taste is horrible (you feel like you're rinsing your mouth with Windex) and your mouth will burn afterwards but I thought if it works, it's worth it.  Then I started to develop brown stains on the edges of my teeth.  I'm getting older so I attributed this to age.  The dentist was not overly concerned and he was able to get the stains off in my normal teeth cleaning, but a few weeks after the cleaning, back came the stains.

Worried about the stains, I decided to step up my game and try Crest Pro-Health Clinical toothpaste.  THEN I started to develop serious gum irritation and tooth pain.  My gums are raw, I feel like my gums are receding, and my teeth often hurt so much I have to take pain medication.  I'm miserable.

Worried about my symptoms, I looked on the internet and found that Crest Pro-Health Clinical products were the culprit!

Procter & Gamble fully acknowledges that the rinse WILL cause the brown staining, although this warning is nowhere on the bottle.  I'm not sure why a company would think it's OK for an oral rinse to stain teeth!  And that's just one side affect - there are more and much more serious than staining.  I think I got off easy.

And then the internet is flooded with reports of the toothpaste causing serious gum irritation and teeth pain.  I don't think this gum irritation is temporary, I think I've permanently damaged my gums.

I have two new bottles of the rinse and two new tubes of the paste that are going into the trash.

Fluke sold me on their brand years ago with the quality and dependability. So I decided to give this one a try, as it is with in my personal budget. I mostly work on refrigeration systems, and seeing warm spots in cases helps determine the problems. The screen is smaller than the one I was use to, but large enough to see anything I need to see. The resolution is fantastic. Sensor speed is very fast. Boot time take a minute or two, but worth the wait. The screen adjusts to what you are looking at, so the hot to cold spots could be a few degrees. For walk in coolers, you can find the one item that is 3 degrees warmer than the others. Most of what I do is ranging from 3 to 20 feet. After spending several days with it, I like it better than the more expensive one I used in the past.
Over all - I give this an extremely high rating. Well worth every penny it cost. It does have its limits, you just need to understand how it works and stay within those limits.

For example-aiming at a shiny surface will results in a reflective heat image. So shiny ceramic tile, stainless steel, water, glass and so forth can actual return an image of your self.
Flat or non-shiny objects will give you the best results. Aiming at for or product works very well and you can see even surface temps rising above the product.

This imager is one very impressive device! Thanks Fluke for getting this one right and with in a price reach that most can afford.
Note: As I prefer the battery operated one vs rechargeable batteries. The reason why us AA batteries are easy to come by, cheap and simple to replace. If you do not use this a ton, the rechargeable battery will not hold up and the cost is not cheap. So before you purchase, keep that in mind.

On some weekends with family over at our house, this is used to cook several 1 pound bacon packages,  which repeatedly runs the unit 10 minutes at a time.  Definitely the stress from longer operating times are harder on the microwave generating ""magnetron tube"" and electronics.  Most other namebrand household duty microwaves lasted us only a year or so.
The reason we love this panasonic inverter/vari-wave:
It uses an inverter, which is like an accelerator pedal in a car.  It lowers the output power by reducing the output of microwave energy. Most other standard brands just cycle 100% power using an ""on and off"" method.  (at a 50% setting - half of the time 100% power is turned on, then half of the time zero power off - in a 10 to 15 second window that repeats to vary the power over time).  Imaging driving your car this way; pressing the accelerator pedal all the way to the floor to hit 100 mph, then coasting back to zero and repeating again.  You may average 50 mph, (like a 50% setting) but the repeated cycling on and off tears up your vehicle, simarly the 100% to zero then back on to 100% cycle on your food in a microwave is not the same as food cooked in a Panasonic inverter controlled at a reduced power over time.

The turbo defrost works really well.  You select type of meat, weight and load food into the microwave and hit start.  It follows a programmed power setting that starts off high, then reduces, and beeps to remind you to turn (or flip over) the food item abouth 1/2 way if you choose to do so.  Or you can ignore and let it continue to defrost.  By comparison, this model does not overheat and cook the outer edges like other brands of microwaves have in our experience.

If you ever have foods that are rated for lower wattage microwave, like 1,000 watts, you can run this Panasonic on a power setting of 8 and perfectly cook your food to match the manufacturer's test kitchen results.  Or you can let it cook on the full ~1200 watt power setting but definitely at a reduced timer setting.

When using the pre-programmed Popcorn button, you select the ounce size of bag you are popping and hit start.  As others have pointed out - you may find that it has burnt your popcorn. BUT the next time you cook popcorn, after you press the Popcorn button, select your size of bag - THEN before you hit start, you can adjust the time shorter or longer using the ""More/Less"" button to adjust to your preferences.  This allows those who like slightly burnt to add more time.  Most of us wanting that just right cooked bag find that using less time pops a perfect bag.  Be aware that Popcorn cook time varies slightly among brands of popcorn.

The Sensor Reheat works extremely well, considering it does not use a probe.

The ""quick minute"" button allows you to place food in the microwave, press this button once, then hit start.  Also nice feature- while it is cooking, let's say that you realize the cheese is not melting, so you need to add more time.  You could wait for the timer to run out and then restart then oven for another minute. But you also can hit the ""quick minute"" while it is cooking and it adds one minute to the running cook time.

When I moved into my new house, the first changes I made were to fix the water softener, and to install a Reverse Osmosis filter system for a tap at the kitchen sink and the refrigerator.  I bought this meter to see how well the filtration was working.  The tapwater is about 600ppm, and the water coming out of the RO unit is about 40ppm.  Having the meter allows me to check periodically for any deterioration of the RO unit.
Honestly, if you have a RO unit, you should get one of these meters to monitor the RO.

Oh, when I first got it, it didn't work.  The first troubleshooting step was successful, and replacing the coin battery fixed it fine.  I thought about marking it down a star for coming with a bad battery, but that seems petty.  It works great, so it gets 5 stars.

On top of that, Kellan's power-hungry father brought down Nate's family.  Fifteen years later, Kellan pops back into Nate's life, with one hell of a request.  Kellan's father has grown sick of Kellan's wild, playboy ways and has cut him off.

Kellan's bent on revenge.  His plan?  He'll publicly come out, even though he's straight.  And the man he'll use as his ""boyfriend"" is Nate, which will definitely send his father over the edge.  Convincing Nate to play along is only the beginning of Kellan's problems.  With Nate back in his life, Kellan's starting to have feelings he thought long buried in the past.  And something about their faux relationship feels like it could be all-too-real...

K. A. Mitchell delivers one heck of an amazing story in Bad Company.  Ms. Mitchell has penned two heroes who, by rights, shouldn't be likeable, and makes them loveable.  At the beginning of Bad Company, Kellan seems like a slutty, irresponsible, man-child.  Yet his growth over the course of the story is truly something to behold.  He grapples with finding his place in the world, addressing his viewpoint on his own sexuality, and struggles with his feelings for Nate.  I loved watching Kellan come into himself and his journey alone could have made Bad Company a fantastic read.  Nate, too, has incredible character development.  When you first meet him, he seems like he's the more ""together"" one of the pair.  Yet, for all Nate's self-assurance, he's got a lot to learn about himself.  Kellan and Nate's individual character arcs are complemented by their developing relationship.  The two hit a lot of road bumps on the path to happily ever after, and most of those problems are created by one or both of them.  But for all those obstacles, Bad Company flows beautifully, buoyed by Nate and Kellan's personalities and the burning heat of sexual tension.  It would be remiss of me not to mention the eroticism of Bad Company because Ms. Mitchell singes the pages with the passion that sparks between Kellan and Nate.  Bad Company is oh-so-good - don't miss this book!

725,3.0,False,"01 23, 2011",AU9VM5YFI8F55,B003YFIYQ0,L. J. Engelke,"Nancy Gideon's Masked By Moonlight has it's ups and downs as a novel.  She has a great talent for writing and delivers an intriguing story line, but it's her characters who drag this novel down and make you question this book.

Charlotte (Cee Cee) Caissie is a New Orleans detective who as of late, has been working more and more crime scenes with mutilated bodies.  Throats ripped out and organs missing, these murders look like the work of a vicious animal.  All signs point her to local mob boss Jimmy Legere.  To her, Jimmy isn't just another con man, he's the man responsible for her father's death and she wants nothing more than to bring him down.

Yet Cee Cee has one problem standing in her way: Max Savoie, Jimmy's right-hand man.  She knows Max is attracted to her and sees her opportunity to finally get to Jimmy and enact her revenge.  What she doesn't expect are the intense feelings she's developing for Max.  The more she's around him, the more she cares for him.  They both know their relationship is impossible.  She's a cop...and he's on the wrong side of the law.  Will they both be able to follow their hearts?

The premise was smart, the hero was sexy and fascinating, but the heroine was about as prickly as a porcupine.  Max was vulnerable, confused and mentally suffering.  He was alone in the world and looking for someone to comfort him...and Cee Cee was not that person.  It seemed every other chapter she was betraying him, manipulating him and stepping on his heart at every opportunity.  So like a beaten dog that doesn't know what else to do, he kept coming back to her.  It was frustrating to read.

I also extend the possibilities of reality with most, if not all books I read.  I understand bending historical accuracies or the norms of reality can make for a great book.  With that in mind, I accepted the attraction between the muscles of a crime mob and a cop.  It had great potential to make for an dynamic story about an impossible couple.  What I had difficulty believing was the lack on consequences each side faced.  There was no mention of a supervisor threatening Cee Cee's job when it became very clear she was crossing lines she wasn't meant to cross.  Max and Jimmy's people were committing crimes and she was either looking the other way or willing to supply him with an alibi.  I couldn't determine if that was romantic or depressing.

The heroine was the main problem.  Some of her issues ultimately just made me dislike her.  Max on the other hand, was a well-crafted alpha who had insecurities that made him absolutely charming.  His youth has been full of emptiness and lacking love, so his feelings towards Cee Cee filled a void in this lost man.  It makes him see his life and situation in a different light and makes him want something better for himself.

Max was fragile on the inside, but to the outside he could be a force to be reckoned with.  It was easy to see why Cee Cee would become weak in the knees around him.

Will I read book two?  Probably.  More than anything, I'm curious where this storyline is going.  Maybe I haven't had enough time to acquaint myself with Charlotte and perhaps the next book will shed a little more light on her character.  While Gideon's writing is solid, and her alpha hero is dead sexy, her storyline is full of holes and her heroine is cringe-worthy.

Just when the story was going somewhere it ended. There was no so called ""training"", there was no exploring of each others world or discussing their or her past to understand her better.

There was no real relationship development of trust bond formed, which is really important in a D/s relationship. There was no real end involved with this book. All we know is she set fire to the book and the gate closed, but not before they miraculously sent the escape-y back to the world, how we don't know since there was only one gate and people were crawling all over it so they couldn't really get to it. There was no real sexual relations that happened between them which, considering what kind of book this was suppose to be, i expected more then i got. We don't know if she decided to stay in her world or go back to their world with them. We were just suppose to accept that there was a happily ever after, but what happily ever after?

POSITIVES:

- The cream is thick  a little goes a long way.
- A big plus was that the complex was not greasy and did not cause any outbreaks.
- Upon application, there was noticeable softening of the skin and over time (2-3 weeks), the firming qualities of the cream became evident.

I have always tried to avoid things like glycolic peels, retinol creams etc because I feared a terrible reaction.  Over the last couple of years I have experimented with them because they are SO good at rejuvenating old skin which is really important.  I've had some terrible reactions with some products but they were cheaper and had ingredients that probably didn't need to be in there.  So onto the review for this.

After I washed my face I put a very small dot of product on my finger and rubbed it on my forehead first.  I figured if I was going to have a reaction, let's start there.  At first it had a slight tingle and then a burning sensation.  Not a bad burning sensation at all just a very very slight sensation.  At first I thought I should wash it off, but I've had this with other products and it goes away if I give it a minute.  It went away.  I waited 2 hours to ensure there was no reaction so that I could apply to the rest of my face, which I did.  Same tingling/burning sensation that went away.

After a winter of not getting much sun, I like to put a little color on my snow white old man legs so I do not blind others when I am wearing shorts.  Over the years, I have come to like and dislike any number of things regarding these products.
First, my likes.  I like mousse over lotions. St. Tropez Self Tan Express Advance Bronzing Mousse is definitely a mousse.  Mousses go on easily with simple disposable gloves, generally do not streak too much, and dry quickly without stickiness.  Lotions vary a lot in those characteristics.  I also like less initial colorant over the active ingredient DHA.  It is the final color that is left after you wash it off that is more important than the initial color. A higher concentration of DHA should mean quicker and darker results.  For those people that may want that instant tan and want to head out immediately, the colorant is important.  St. Tropez has a typical amount.  Me? I put it on and let it react for 3-4 hours then wash it off.

Now, for my dislikes.  Universally, all of these products have tons of fragrance.  I guess it is to cover up an unnatural odor of the raw ingredients (but I do not know).  St. Tropez is a tropical fruity odor which, while not objectionable, is strong, and (personally) I would not venture outside the house with it on.  This is the way it is with all self tanners I have tried, so it is not a knock for the current product, just one of my dislikes.  I also do not like stuff that runs too much -- hence the mousse.  If you use a liquid, you need to do it in a shower or tub to avoid other surfaces that you may not be able to wash easily.  (Colorant on a white carpet?!)

For the St. Tropez, the mousse goes on smooth and easy.  It dried in a matter of minutes.  The fragrance as noted is strong but not unpleasant -- but you will be smelling it until you take a shower!  The tan it leaves after a shower is as natural as it gets for self tanners -- for me a slight brown to orange color -- just enough color to keep the snow white quality down while the natural sunlight produces some real color on my legs.  Most people do not notice that it is not a ""real tan"", unless you applied it unevenly or missed a spot.  Generally, at the beginning of shorts season I tend to reapply about once every 7-10 days.

I like the St. Tropez Self Tan Express Advance Bronzing Mousse.  It is what I expected -- easy to put on, it dries moderately quickly, and when washed off the resultant color is great.

This eyeliner comes with a smudger on one end that can twist off to reveal a small sharpener. I don't think the sharpener is necessary with this type of eyeliner since it is an extremely thin, push up stick...not an actual pencil. However, it is a neat thought. You can also use the smudger to clean up the lines on your eyeliner right after you apply it since it acts somewhat like an eraser.

This eyeliner glides on dark and easy. You do need to leave it alone for a minute or so after applying (if you don't want to smudge it), otherwise it may smear or smudge. If you give it the time to dry, then it does not smudge. The eyeliner lasted all day for me (I did use Urban Decay primer potion to help set it).

The other problem is the cost, though on Amazon that tends to vary, even within the same day, so I don't know how much this will be selling for on the day you happen to see it.

First, I will say that I have thick hair and that this product is extremely lightweight. If you have thin hair and need something with a bit more holding power this probably won't be a good product for you.

What I like about the Baxter:
(+) Lightweight. I live in the swampy Midwest and hate heavy hair products that frequently feel greasy and even start to mix with sweat (when working out). No such problem with the Baxter formula.

(+) Odor. Or more specifically the lack of a strong odor in this product. There are some citrus and eucalyptus notes but they're very subtle.

(+) Application. The grooming lotion is opaque but rubs in clear and disappears easily into hair without any white streaks.

(+) Hold. Apply with water onto damp hair for a sleek finish or apply a small amount to almost dry hair for a more natural looking finish. The hold is light but on my thick hair it's perfect.

I subscribe to and read four business magazines and three financial newspapers on a regular basis.  Between Forbes, Fortune and BusinessWeek, I always look most forward to receiving my next issue of Forbes.  Why?  Several reasons:
- The articles are generally shorter and more ""to the point"" than Fortune.  Forbes is also not as beholden as BusinessWeek is to cover the hot news stories.
- This magazine is the best of the three for discovering new investment ideas and it is generally more investor focused than either Fortune or BW.
- The editorials throughout the magazine are usually thought-provoking and I guarantee you will develop your own favorite columnists whom you will look forward to reading in each issue
- Forbes has a politically conservative and pro-business slant (with Steve Forbes as Editor-in-Chief, that should be no surprise).
- Forbes offers two supplemental issues, which are quarterly.  Forbes ASAP is entirely focused on technology and many articles are actually thought pieces written by influential executives, investors, and technology visionaries.  Forbes FYI features lighter articles which are thematically aimed at the upper class.  You will probably find some of the stories (and the ads) irrelevant to your life (we're not all millionaires yet, are we?).  But it's an amusing magazine and it's a good break for me from the stream of more business-oriented stuff I read.

Maxim is the last Laddie still in print in the U.S., having witnessed the print burials for FHM (1996 to 2007) and Stuff (1998 to 2007). Maxim's putrefaction is evident to its subscribers, hence the heavily discounted subscriber rates available today.

Don't get me wrong, puppies are cute. I like puppies. Everybody does.

You may not want to pay an annual subscription for a magazine that looks and acts like a puppy, though.  That's your call. I wanted SI, but that venerable publication can't be had for the price of frequent flyer miles like ESPN The Magazine can. So I compromised.

By comparison with SI, ESPN The Magazine gives you a flashier, big-photo, post-modern jumble of short pieces that seems to derive from the verbal, television-friendly style of its parent. I'm not the deepest of sports fan, so I don't mind this. But if you're after the kind of in-depth analysis that SI offers, you might be disappointed by this alternative.

ESPN The Magazine is definitely a *fun* read, and if that's what you want, you'll like this. When my first issue came wrapped in a 'special promotional issue cover jacket' that presented Ricky Bobby as 'Sports Figure of the Year?', I knew instantly that this publication couldn't be all bad.

They commissioned vacation home designs from architects, told you how to build a radio, and helped you maintain your car (anyone remember Smokey's Garage?)

Today's PopSci is 90 pages of brief essays, and there's nothing here you can't find by browsing a few web pages like Engadget, Science Daily, and yes, PopSci's own website. Instructables has more projects than you'll find a a year of PS.

I think that ""Money"" is an excellent publication for neophyte investors, as it does provide generally sound information and advice. It is very good at explaining terminology in plain English, which is to be applauded, but investors with more knowledge of investments and financial planning would probably be better off with another magazine, like ""Kiplinger's"", for instance.

I have been reading this magazine for about six months now and there are several things about it that make it worthwhile. The thing that stands out the most are the photographs, and I'm not talking about just the stunning scenery one normally associates with the West (like the National Parks or the coastline). Even the ordinary pictures are striking. In the Gardening section, for example, it is common to find pictures of family homes that have beautifully landscaped yards full of blossoming flowers and colorful plants. In the Home & Design section, one can find nice photographs of home interiors, showing different designs and furniture.

One of the most unique qualities of Sunset is the fact that it is published in five different editions. There is a specially designed issue for the Northwest (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska, and British Columbia), Northern California (Northern California and the majority of Nevada), Southern California (Southern California and Hawaii), The Southwest (Arizona, New Mexico, and the Las Vegas area of Nevada), and Rocky Mountain (Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah). This is a nice idea and it's one that other magazines should consider emulating. Based on where you live or where you have an active interest, this will be the region that your issue spends its pages covering. My subscription is for the Northern California region, so I am treated each month to articles about places like San Francisco, Sacramento, Reno (Nevada), Lake Tahoe, etc.

One of the specialties of this magazine is food and it is common to find recipes throughout every issue. There is a special section set aside for food, but one can expect to find food articles and recipes everywhere as they read. Even the cover page of each issue features a food dish. And as you might guess, the featured recipes are generally those types of cuisine normally associated with each specific region of the west, with plenty of generic recipes thrown in to make sure everyone has something to cook.

One of the specialty sections of this magazine that I like is the ""Value Vacation""- a subsection of Travel & Recreation. This section highlights a specific place to travel and then offers a day by day breakdown of things to do and places to see, with the cost for each itemized so you know exactly what to expect. The highlighted city or tourist area can be anyplace in the west and isn't limited to the region that your issue covers. This section is nice because it lets you see in black & white what it will cost for a few days of budget entertainment. It reminds me of some of the television programs shown on the Travel Channel.

Advertisements cover about 40 to 50 percent of the pages of each issue and they are often found in bunches in the front and back and on alternating pages for much of the rest of each issue (typical for most magazines). The ads can center on all sorts of different things. Because this is a combination travel/culture/food/entertainment/home & garden/living magazine, the ads cover a wide range of products and services, from laundry detergent to credit cards to cat food.

Overall, Sunset has proven itself an enjoyable magazine. I don't live in the western United States but this region is my favorite part of the country, so it makes sense that I would find something of value in this publication. I like the photography, the personal stories, the gardening and decorating ideas, and most other aspects of this magazine. If you're dead set in your ways and refuse to read about anything that deviates from your Eastern, Southern, or Midwestern lifestyle, then you may not like Sunset. But for the majority of people, Sunset has much to offer with pages and pages of eye- catching pictures and friendly articles about life in the American West.",Sunset Fills You With Visions of the Western U.S.,1137888000

The pictures are beatiful. The homes that this magazines shows are usually realistic and always lovely. Many of the ideas are creative ones that anyone with a little bit of talent can do for themselves. The homes tend to lean towards a country charm and a more classic, lived in look than the show room homes typically seen in a magazine.

And I will even admit, I was among them at the time. I didn't understand the depth of ""Blade Runner"" until I had had subsequent multiple experiences of it. I don't know if you really see Blade Runner as much as become absorbed into it. Although Blade Runner was a box office disappointment upon its release, it had stiff competition in 1982. Spielberg's ""ET"", the sentimental science fiction film, had broken all box office records; Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, was the favorite for pure good guy versus bad guy SF; and other films outside the genre were much more uplifting and linear, such as ""Tootsie"" and ""An Officer and a Gentleman"". (The other under-appreciated masterpiece of that year was ""Sophie's Choice"", although Meryl Streep did deservedly win for Best Actress.)

Despite its mixed critical reception, including a very ambivalent review by Roger Ebert who called it a ""failure as a story"", ""Blade Runner"" has emerged as one the three best films of 1982, the other two being ""Ghandhi"" and ""Sophie's Choice"". My revised list of Best Picture nominees in alphabetical order for 1982: ""Blade Runner"", ""E.T."" ""Ghandhi"", ""Missing"", ""Sophie's Choice"". I would still give top award nods to Ghandhi but only by the slimmest of margins. Blade Runner would be my very close second choice. (""The Verdict"" and ""Tootsie"" are good films but not exactly masterpieces.)

The story concerns relatively new technology: the producing of humanoid cyborgs which have become dangerously close to human life. They are called ""Replicants"". The latest models appear to have feelings and emotions like humans. Now, some renegade Replicants who feel they were treated as slaves on a labor planet have sprung from their ""slavery"" and returned to earth. They wish to confront their creators. Richard ""Rick"" Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a ""blade runner"", a kind of detective/police officer who finds and exterminates renegade Replicants. One of his tools is a series of questions offered a suspected Replicant designed to create responses which tip-off the questioner as to whether or not the participant is human. But then Decker falls for a female Replicant, Rachel (Sean Young) who seems all too human.

In the 1950's and 1960's, a very select group of eclectic readers absorbed and appreciated the work of a somewhat lesser-known science fiction writer, Philip K. Dick. Dick was a maverick of the SF genre, essentially immersing readers into a world much more reminiscent of the works of Raymond Chandler and Dashiel Hammett than Gene Roddenbery or George Lucas. Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade could navigate Blade Runner's darkened and misty streets much more effectively than either James T. Kirk or Luke Skywalker. While the most popular writers of the SF genre were still getting into rocket ships and flying to planets for high adventure, Dick was painting on an entirely new canvas, where urban noir meets future technology. Flying taxis and large plasma screens reside along with overpopulation and dirty streets. And he was writing in the 1950's and 1960's! However, even by 1982, audiences were still craving the likes of heroic science fiction such as Star Trek and Star Wars. Typical audience sensibility was still far behind ""Blade Runner"".

What made ""Blade Runner"" tough on audiences at the time of its release and so appreciated today is that it challenges viewers' perceptions of not only the future but the nature of modern reality itself. Unlike Star Wars and Star Trek, ""Blade Runner"" is a cautionary tale, an updated version of ""Frankenstein: The Modern Prometheus"" and therefore, everything presented in its world is at the very least disconcerting and at the worst quite horrifying. SF has been predominantly about Utopias. ""Blade Runner"" is a story set in a ""Dystopia"". SF most often distinguishes between right and wrong, good and bad. ""Blade Runner"" is about the blurry shades between ethics and justice, where the ones with which we most empathize are outlaws. SF endings are often neat and tidy. ""Blade Runner"" offers a very ambiguous and contemplative ending (and I am not referring to the final coda of the original theatrical release). ""Blade Runner"" deals with themes concerning the larger questions of life and meaning, very uncommon in SF cinema as a whole. And that's why ""Blade Runner"" has become not only an iconic classic of the SF genre, it is one of the reasons that cinema has continued to be a captivating medium. ""Blade Runner"" is in the same company as ""Ghandhi"", ""Citizen Kane"", and ""Casablanca"". Know that SF can sometimes transcend its own genre, and BR inspired a new wave of films, such as ""The Matrix"" and ""Dark City"".

Placed in a prison work gang, he experiences the brutal side of life, but he never stops rebelling.  When his mother dies, his response is to pick up a banjo and sing the hilariously satirical song, ""Plastic Jesus.""  Near the end he is in a church, where he kneels and prays, but his prayer goes unanswered and he receives no help, because (as he already knows) God does not exist.  In the end, Luke gets his wish for death, and dies with a smile on his face, because he has escaped a painful life.

Directed by Steven Spielberg and with a stellar cast comprising Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, Matthew McConaughey and newcomer Djiman Housou, this film not only promises to be a winner it delivers. The film opens with a victory as enslaved Africans break free from the shackles that bind them together. After they slay all but 2 of their captors and take over the ship their promise of freedom is doomed when they land on the East American coastline.

Their trial is a bitter struggle for freedom. Despite their determined defence led by a young and enlightened lawyer (McConaughey) and freed coloured man (Freeman) they face strong opposition from their captors and pro-slave Americans. Spielberg inflicts the audience with confronting scenes of violence and the inhumanity that the slaves were subjected to on the ship, La Amistad. He further exposes mans inhumanity towards the slaves, who are treated as goods bought and sold for profit.

One of the films greatest strengths is that it tells the less known story of the slave trade where the initial captors are fellow Africans. From this point on they are goods processed by middle men to their common destination; a southern plantation. These slaves fight for freedom is also the catalyst for change that slave owners feared would herald the beginning of the end of slavery. After a gruelling and bitter fight the slaves win their freedom. Their struggle also shows how they influenced and changed the minds of the most powerful Americans during the 19th century.",Great victory in the fight against slavery,1454803200

Their senses of timing are tremendous and both have a gift for physical comedy and wringing the best out of every line of dialogue.  I disagree with the original Amazon staff reviewer (I believe the ""official"" Amazon review has since changed to a more positive judgment), I think this movie is very well constructed, with a tight plotline and just the right balance of jokes and exposition.  Not a word  or scene is wasted.  The humor is  absurdist but good-natured, as in older-style films, and the supporting cast does standout service.  This is a very underrated comedy, in my view, and I give it a high recommendation for fans of either of these fine actors or zany comedy in general.  A very refreshing change from in-you-face gross-out jokes and sophomoric scatalogical/sexual put-down gags that pass as ""comedy"" in so many films today. ""Housesitter"" just zips and zings along from one wild confrontation to another as the teetering house of lies constructed by Hawn (at first) and then Martin becomes ever-more unwieldy and incoherent.

I was just a young kid when I first saw ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" and I really didn't have a clue what was going on during the surburban angst sequences. But oh how I loved the finale, a special effects-choked extravaganza which became one of the most famous scenes in cinema history. The film's seemingly endless buildup had some kind of payoff, and director Steven Spielberg's career was set for life (well, he did follow this film with ""1941"").

The spring of 1978 was the season of ""Star Wars"" and ""Close Encounters."" My friends and I would debate the qualities of ""Star Wars"" and ""Close Encounters,"" arguing as to which was the better film. For me, a junior high school lad, the greatest film in history was ""Close Encounters.""

I still love Spielberg's epic UFO creation, a sort of quasi-religious experience for a kid raised on ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Invaders From Mars."" In ""Close Encounters,"" the aliens were friendly and most shocking of all - we were nice to them! This had not been done before, as the alien standard was a growling James Arness dressed as a murderous carrot.

These days I still get a child-like thrill when watching ""Close Encounters."" The opening two-thirds of the film are no longer ponderous, but identifiable. The awkward situations of a struggling middle-class family are realistically portrayed. Paul Schrader, noted author of ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Hardcore,"" wrote the original draft to this film. One suspects the obsessions and frustrations of Richard Dreyfuss' character came from his tortured pen.

Dreyfuss plays Roy Neary, working-class father and husband who witnesses what he believes to be a UFO. He finds himself tortured by visions seemingly stuck in his head, and he becomes obsessed with UFOs. Like an alcoholic, Neary soon falls apart, losing his job, friends and eventually his family in several harrowing scenes. He befriends Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon), a single mother who has also witnessed these UFOs and is obsessed with similar visions. Her son is abducted by the aliens in one of the most terrifying scenes in film history. Together, this tortured couple eventually realizes these visions are mysteriously pointing them towards Devil's Tower in Wyoming. Frantically, they travel there even though the U.S. military claims a train wreck has caused deadly gas to cover the countryside. Scientist Claude Lacombe (Francois Truffaut) and his eccentric team have devised a musical language enabling them to communicate with the UFOs. The meeting place is, of course, Devil's Tower in Wyoming. Neary and Guiler fight their way to the mountain, stumbling upon a government-constructed landing strip where Lacombe and his scientists hope to meet the aliens. An enormous mothership appears and contact is made with aliens for the first time in human history.

This is not a simple story, and the drama which plays out between Neary and his wife (Teri Garr) is brilliant. Guiler's angst for her missing son is also perfectly portrayed by Dillon, one of the finest character actresses of this era. But the core of ""Close Encounters,"" the moment of truth so to say, is the sequence involving the aliens. There are so many hundreds of ways this scene could have gone wrong. The aliens could have looked fake, but they didn't. The lighting could have been wrong, but it wasn't. The aliens are portrayed as being just as shy as we are - a perfect choice. There's a sense of wonder throughout these extraordinary proceedings. Eventually, one gets the feeling that if we truly meet brothers from another planet, it will happen much as it does in ""Close Encounters.""

A battle left in obscurity because it represented America's highest attrition in any battle during WWII and clearly the poorest leadership. A lofty subject the execution of which was mutilated by inummerable basic errors in tactical details and equipment. The quality of the film is eroded further by a simplistic and inaccurate script, substandard directing, and mediocre acting.

The script is flawed in that the language and even the situations are purely modern anachronisms so that the characters end up talking and behaving as if they were in Vietnam at Hue 24 years later.  The tactical decisions each enlisted and officer makes in the film are laughable.  The characters portrayed are so inept that they must have been in a coma during basic training.  For some absurd reason, it seems like every GI in that film feels compelled to come out of his fox hole and talk to his buddies without care while being shelled or in full battle; as if having a pleasant walk in the park. Ask any vet, unless ordered to do so or a fellow soldier is injured, no soldier in his right mind would do something like that when being bombarded by artillery.  At one point some guys pick up a flame thrower that uses a fire hose (a fire hose????) to shoot the flame!

Directed by David Butler

Robert Kittredge (Bob Hope) is the Moscow correspondent for a major American news service, who is fired when he neglects to file a report about Hitler's invasion of Russia. Hoping to get back in the good graces of his boss Norman Mason (Donald MacBride), Kittredge steals another reporter's story about a Nazi spy ring operating in New York.

An excellent Bob Hope vehicle with Otto Preminger good fun as the head Nazi, Otto Fauscheim. This was Hope first starring role for MGM - he followed up a year later with The Princess and the Pirate (also directed by David Butler).

Bob Hope in his prime and the one-liners provided for him here are classics. The often underrated Miss Lamour shines as a Lois Lane-type reporter. She and Hope have fabulous chemistry together and their comic timing as a team is impeccable. David Butler again proves he was one of Hollywood classic era's most capable and underrated directors. Wisely, they allow the villains to play it straight to give this mostly light film a serious(but not too much so) undertone which makes it seem edgier and thus more effective as a comedy thriller.

Best scene is when Hope and Donald Meek playing an addled old caretaker who believes the Civil War is still going on. The two of them reprise a couple of old burlesque routines in Abbott and Costello style.

I am not a huge fan of the Zombie genre, but enjoy them quite a bit.  I understand the ""rules"" and like watching a movie that works well within it's own particular idiom.  I can say the same about Romantic Comedies, Documentaries and Action Adventure flicks.  When they're done well I enjoy the heck out of them.
That having been said, Resident Evil compares favorably among it's fellows.  I'm not going to discuss plot because there are a few hundred reviews posted here on Amazon that explain pretty much everything.  Besides, you really don't want me to ruin it, do you?
There is more action than gore, but it's pretty graphic action so Argento freaks may not walk away happy but the rest of us will have a good time.  There is an Aliens type feel to the elite military team, but the characters are very broadly sketched and there's not a lot of feeling for them as they fall victim to the beasts and nasties that inhabit the lair beneath the mansion.  Still, seeing a few hundred zombies ganging up on five or six well trained commandoes makes up for the lack of characterization.
As far as the effects go, my only complaint is the CGI work on the most monstrous of the beasties.  The concept was excellent, but the execution left a bit to be desired.  Resident Evil is based on a computer game and the monster looked like he was lifted right off a Playstation and dropped onto the set.  I actually chuckled at one point when he was climbing up a wall and looking over his shoulder.  My finger automatically sought out a fire button to waste his sorry behind.
All that having been said I do have one major complaint about this flick.  Are we supposed to believe that these folks live in a world where there has not been a single zombie movie ever made?  Reanimated dead folks, shambling through corridors trying to eat human flesh and none of these crack commandoes have the presence of mind to try a head shot?  I know with small arms it's advisable to shoot for the center of the target, but how many rounds do you put into something's chest before you try another target?  It's a small complaint, I know, but just once I wish a character in one of these movies would have seen a Romero movie some time in their life.

Bret Easton Ellis' novel American Psycho is the nadir of the eighties novel; it reads, roughly, like a three hundred page Sharper Image catalog, an endless listing of brand names and prices with nothing even remotely resembling a soul. When the film was released, the critics quickly came to the same conclusion about it. After a few months, however, better reviews of the film began to surface fromindependent critics and the like, calling it a
brilliant satire, wickedly funny, you know, that sort of thing. So I had to rent it. My constant repeating thought was ""it can't be as bad as the book.""

I was right. That's not saying much.

Christian Bale (who's going to be typecast as a sleazebag if he doesn't watch out) plays Patrick Bateman, a man whose obsession with fitting in to the fast-moving upperclass Wall Street society of his father manifests itself both as an obsession with the brand names of the things he utilizes in his daily routine and as an unstoppable compulsion to murder.

Herron, who's certainly no stranger to ultraviolence (she's directed episodes of Homicide and Oz, as well as the cult hit I Shot Andy Warhol), does manage to capture a certain beauty to Bateman's homicidal rage; there's a particular scene where Bateman is chasing a prostitute (Cara Seymour) down a hallway with a chainsaw that's almost hypnotic. Where the movie fails is in the spaces between. It's almost as if Ellis wrote the novel on a bet-- ""can you take a perfectly shallow character and center a whole book around him?"" The result, in both book and film, is painfully obvious; it can be done, but it's not that much fun to experience.

This makes it all the more painful that so many wonderful roles surface in this film, not least up-and-comer Chloe Sevigny as Bateman's secretary, a woman who stands out as the true beauty in a shallow world of glamour; Jared Leto (Requiem for a Dream) as Paul Allen, a business partner of Bateman's; Reese Witherspoon as Bateman's oblivious, apoiled fiancee; and Willem Dafoe, as usual, taking a minor role (a homicide detective) and turning it into something palpably creepy.

`Dolores Claiborne' tells the story of Dolores, a middle-aged woman working as a housekeeper in Maine.  When her employer Vera winds up dead and Claiborne is found standing over her dead body with a weapon in hand it is only expected that she would wind up being the prime suspect.  Dolores's grown daughter Selena, now working as a journalist, comes to see her mother during the investigation.  They haven't spoken in years, and their reunion only stirs up awful memories of Selena's childhood and her father Joe who wound up dead when she was still quite young.  Her mother was prime suspect at the time, but lack of evidence kept her from behind bars.  The Detective who worked Joe's murder case is also working Vera's and his grudge against Dolores is what may wind up bringing closure to both these deaths.

The storytelling here is amazing, for the film flows like a well written novel in that it manages to flesh out each and every scene.  Sure, it could have been tightened in a few areas, but for the most part it is very fluid in its delivery.

The real showcase here though is the acting.  Kathy Bates is stellar as Dolores, delivering an award worthy performance that is the stark opposite of her Oscar winning turn in `Misery'.  She is calm and reclusive and very guarded, but her inner suffering is boiling right under her skin.  Judy Parfitt is also quite wonderful as Vera, Dolores's strong willed employer.  Christopher Plummer is always outstanding, and his gruff delivery here brings his stock character to another level; and David Strathairn is unforgettable as the sadistic Joe.  A lot of praise is heaped up Jennifer Jason Leigh in general.  Many people consider her this amazing actress who is Oscar snubbed over and over but I can't really find a reason to consider her all that noteworthy.  Everything I've seen of her has been decent at best, this performance included.  I found her serviceable, and at times she was great, but nothing extraordinary, and nothing that most other actresses couldn't pull off.

I wish that the film had been a little more intense, I will say that.  The film flows almost so serenely that it lacks any real bite.  This isn't a horrible thing, but it takes a little away from the end result.  When the revelations were revealed it didn't feel so shocking or spine chilling because I felt numbed over by the films fluidity.  It's a small gripe when you look at the big picture, but it's a gripe none-the-less.  All in all though, `Dolores Claiborne' is a great film that is sure to satisfy any fan of the genre, the writer or the star.",This is not `Misery' redux; just so you know...,1221782400

I got this instead of the Behringer PB600 because this one is 1inch higher and has an extra pocket on the left of the handle when looking at it where I have my tin full of picks, also because it doesn't have the buzzing problem reported with the PB600 because of apparent poor power supply. It costs $70 more but those relatively minor things are what made me buy it, and I'm very glad I did. One other thing is that this board has eggshell foam on the inside of the lid to pad your pedals in transit where the the PB600 does not.

So I use this to play at church 2 times a week, practice and Sunday services. So the portability is very nice and it's easy to handle in all aspects of the process. It has 7 ports on the chain so I have 6 pedals and a tuner, the board fits everything nicely. I did build my pedals around this board so do keep that in mind.

Overall I really do like it for what it is and my current stage of gear it fits my needs perfectly, but there are things where I'm still left wanting, mainly the size, and I realize that this board isn't the end all be all board, but it's great for what it is.

889,5.0,False,"03 3, 2011",A3THYZVMVUHXNL,B0002D02NA,Mr. Googie,"A few years ago, InCase came out with the Slim Bag. It was the best guitar case ever made--a gig bag with hard interior walls that protects like a hardshell case. Then, for no apparent reason, it was discontinued. SuXX0rZ. Maybe because it cost over $200. I came upon the Protec Contego in an online search. It looked like a knockoff of my beloved Slim Bag, but at 1/3 the price. I took a chance and ordered one.

For 1/3 the price, I got 5/8 the case, and I'm no math whiz, but I think that's a good deal.

Construction:
- The construction of the bag is excellent, with heavy-duty stitching throughout.
- The canvas-like material is thick.
- The interior components (fuzzy stuff, faux leather patches over bridge and headstock areas) are sturdy, though the moveable (nice touch) pad to hold the neck in place seems a little flimsy.

Features:
- There are plastic bumpers on the bottom to protect the fabric when you put the case down.
- The backpack straps are good, comfortable, though the simple velcro strap that holds them down when not in use is a budget solution: the InCase and my Reunion Blues Continental bags have zippered compartments.
- Protection is AWESOME. It's equal to any non-flight-rated hard case.
- The pockets are all useful and well thought out. The big pocket will fit a 15"" laptop and/or a pile of sheet music. The upper pocket is great for strings and picks.
- There's a handle on the side, and one on the back that you can't see in the picture. Both are solid.

All in all, the Contego is an excellent bag. If you've ever owned an InCase Slim Bag, you'll be disappointed, as every feature of the Contego is a budget version of the Slim Bag. I would argue that much of what made the Slim Bag so great was that it was almost over-the-top high quality. The Contego is more than good enough for the professional musician. It's a great value for the price.

Having all the tension rods at about the same tension makes doing the final tuning MUCH easier.  That said, you need to be careful using this key, and there's a trick that may help you.
Here's what I do.
After you put a new head on, tighten all the rods until they just touch the hoop.
Then finger tighten them all about the same amount.
Now start with the torque key at a very low level, and go around the lugs at least twice in your normal tuning pattern.

Tighten the key, and repeat.  Do this until you get close to the pitch you want, going around your lug pattern at least twice at each tension.

And here's the trick.  Once you are close to pitch, because static friction is greater than dynamic friction, it helps if you loosen the tension rod 1/16 or 1/8 of a turn before tightening them.  If you do this, breaking the friction before tightening, you'll find that all of a sudden one or two rods will turn another 1/8 or 1/4 of turn, and suddenly all the others will move a little more to.  Using that trick, this little toy can get each lug to within 1 or 2 Hz of each other while you watch music videos, sports, or your favorite TV show.

All that is left is to fine tune a little bit, but you'll probably have to turn of the TV for that part.  One more thing, like another reviewer said, if you have rusty or dirty threads on the tension rods, all bets are off, because it will take more torque to get the same tension on the rods.",There is a trick to using this key,1362960000

I liked the idea of quieter and could afford the extra premium.  This pump developed a crack in the plastic plate, and since the pump was relatively new and in good condition, I went to find a replacement plate. Turns out that on this Halcyon model, you cannot just replace that part: you have to buy an entire new pump.  Bad luck maybe, until you do some research and see that it is fairly common to develop cracks in the plate.

Therefore, I had to buy a new pump and went with this version because the parts most likely to fail are also replaceable.  Works just fine and it not significantly louder than its quieter, more selfish cousin.",Better to buy this than the quieter Halcyon version.,1398902400

Perhaps I am comparing this variety to that one too much, but this one is just a little less of a hit with my family and the birds.  Don't be mistaken---it's high quality bird food.  It has great ingredients, and you can tell it doesn't feel dusty or full of shell bits like some cheap brands.  However, the second ingredient is white millet, which to me is sort of a filler seed.  The bird attracted to this are the same birds that come when we have cheaper food out---most of all, the silly house sparrows, who sit at the feeder and eat all the food up.  With the fruit and nut mix, I got a brand new bird right away---a Red Breasted Woodpecker, but so far, this one has attracted only the usual crowd---the house sparrows, a lot of chickadees (which are of course always welcome), nuthatches, juncos and a few starlings.  A cardinal came and had a look, but hasn't been back!

I can't tell you how much money I wasted on things that he would not even give a second glance much less bother to play with.  I finally broke down and got this since I figured if nothing else he would like the scratcher part of the toy.

The first night after we brought it home from the store he attacked (I do not use that word loosely) the scratcher part.  I mean he went to town on it!  It took a couple of evenings for us to get him to stop scratching long enough to realize that there was a ball that went around it also.

For reasons that are a mystery to my husband and I our cat gets extra frisky after he has gone to the bathroom.  He will run around the house like gang-busters and will chase at anything.  This is the time that he will go after the ball, he will play with it for about 20-25 minutes (which is long for a cat) and then he will go to town on the scratching.

One of the things that I really like about the scratching part is that I can turn it over once he has annihilated the cardboard and it is as fresh as new.  You will have to pick up little pieces of cardboard and sometimes the ball won't roll because the pieces of cardboard accumulate in that area, but it's worth it.  We ended up going to the pet store for replacements after about a month and since they come two in a pack, we are really getting four!

It is really grounded too!  No matter how rough he gets with the scratching it stays put.  Of course I should probably mention that it is placed on the carpet, it may not do so well on hardwood or other types of flooring.  If you don't have carpet then it fits well in the bottom of his cat tree like it's one of the levels of play!

I was nervous about spending so much and not knowing if my 2 dogs (lab and German Shepherd/Whippet mix) were gonna like this but they absolutely love it.  The mix gal is a very picky eater so we do raw meat in the mornings and Taste of the Wild kibble at night but she will sometimes not eat the kibble.  So, I've been mixing this in with the kibble and some water... she eats it every time.  They will even eat it if it is mixed in with the raw meat or just a a little bowl of this and water.  Initially they say to give the dogs a double dose for the first 2 months so my 65 pound black Lab got 1.5 scoops and my little gal who is 43 pounds got 1 scoop.  They both have allergies in the summer real bad so this really has helped to cut back on the scratching and chewing on their paws.  I was supposed to cut back to .75 scoop and 1/2 scoop but am doing about 1 scoop for the black lab and .75 for the little gal.  I am doing that thru the allergy season and then will cut back a little more.  This is much better than steroid shots which they had last year and it was brutal on them.  Now they get this and some Benadryl each day and life is good this summer.

Unrefined coconut oil has a smoke point of 280 degrees Fahrenheit, whereas, refined coconut oil's smoke point is 365 degrees Fahrenheit making it great for high heat cooking or sauting.

GRADE A: Unrefined, Fair Trade, Certified organic by the USDA, Canada Organic, BC Certified Organic, Ecocert, first pressed VCO and Kosher. Hand pressed and cold-pressed to produce raw oil from fresh coconuts in as little as two hours.
GRADE B: Unrefined, Fair Trade, Certified organic by the USDA, Kosher, cold-pressed from fresh coconuts. Unknown if first pressed, Not Ecocert, Not raw oil produced in couple hours or less like Grade A.
GRADE C: Unrefined, Certified organic by the USDA, Kosher, cold-pressed from fresh coconuts. Unknown if first pressed, Not Fair Trade, Not Ecocert, Not raw oil produced in couple hours or less like Grade A.
GRADE D: REFINED, Certified organic by the USDA, Kosher, cold-pressing/expeller pressing. Unknown if first pressed, Not Fair Trade, Not Ecocert, Not from fresh coconuts but from copra, Not raw oil produced in couple hours or less like Grade A.

This is GRADE C VCO. I consume GRADE A and B with a spoon right out of the jar but for popcorn I go with GRADE C. I do not consume refined or GRADE D. When heated, just like any food item, VCO loses its nutritional value. As a beauty product, I mix VCO with CO+AO since CO+AO are my favorite oils for my skin. Not  a FT VCO which are the best of best, not a extra virgin oil since it is a lie, this is only a three star VCO or lower grade.

I use VCO in the mix for my hair, shaving cream, soap, hand lotion, face lotion, body lotion, tooth paste as well as I make popcorn and consume it straight out of the jar for its nutrients. Years ago, I was able to get raw, hand pressed coconut oils from fresh coconuts from Mexico produced right here in US but due to popularity of VCOs, many producers have been creative in making money by misleading shoppers as well as many misleading reviews by shoppers certainly has hyped the business of VCO to another level. Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is a lie since Extra Virgin applies only to olive oil and infact the VCO market has become so saturated that many producers are removing extra from their labeling and calling it virgin coconut oil, no more extra virgin. In Canada where the best VCOs are produced, it is illegal to even use the term, extra virgin for coconut oil but in US the laws are very relaxed. There is no Extra Virgin coconut oil, only virgin, there is no pure, no #1, no 100%, no premium liquid, or any of those terms used for marketing reasons.

First, DVD burning.  Toast allows you to import all sorts of video files, and burn them onto a video DVD, for viewing in your set-top DVD player.  This is a great feature, if you have some Divx video files, on your hard drive.  Drag them into the video folder in toast, and burn a video DVD.

Furthermore, do you have some un-encrypted DVDs, perhaps ones made in your set-top DVD recorder with video camera footage of your family?  With toast, you can import titles from those unencrypted DVDs, and put them onto a DVD, with fun and easy to navigate menus.

New to Toast 7 is a great new feature that allows you to compress an unencrypted video DVD image into a size that will fit onto a single-layer disk.  This basically gives you the functionality of popcorn built right into Toast 7.

Data Backup - Toast works fantastic as a backup utility.  There is even an application included to schedule backups on a regular basis.  Toast 7 allows for disk-spanning backups, which allows you to backup many gigabytes of data over multiple DVDs or CDs.

Audio - Toast 7 will obviously allow you to burn music CDs, but you can also burn a DVD.  The DVD will load on a set-top DVD player, with menus, to select music, and a shuffle feature.  You can get gigabytes of music onto these disks, and then play them in your DVD player.

Pictures - Toast 7 includes an application called Motion Pictures HD, which allows the importing of photos to make great slideshows.  They can be in beautiful widescreen, or even high-definition, if you make a Divx DVD (note that Divx DVDs can only be played in special DVD players).

Import Analog Audio - CD Spin Doctor is included with Toast 7, so you can easily import analog audio via your computer's audio input.  You might input audio, from a VHS tape, cassette tape, or record.

Discus RE - Discus RE is a simple, but convenient way to create labels, for your DVDs.  It includes the templates, for dozens of the most popular DVD labels, so then all you have to do is design your label and print it.  Easy.

[...]

Overall, I have only had Toast 7, for a few days now.  However, it might be the most useful application I have ever purchased, for my Macintosh.  Toast 7 allows you to do just about anything you would want to do, when it comes to burning DVDs and CDs.  Furthermore, it is easy to use.

Ratings-wise, for anti-phishing, comes in slightly behind my  standard, Norton. Still acceptable.

While fairly simple to install, the feature set for Mac and iOS is pretty limited. So if you are a Mac and Apple user, skip this and find a more feature-rich software to protect your devices and files.

One reason that it is less powerful for Apple is in the news right now: Apple's internal security is so tight, they don't share much with outside vendors to allow them past the security features. What's out is out--and they are arguing with the FBI for the same reason; if you provide a backdoor to one organization, even a law enforcement agency, that ""key"" can get away from you and someone will pay handsomely to be able to compromise iOS. So McAfee is limited to more or less backing up your photos and securing them with a PIN, an alarm and a remote ""wipe my data"" and backing up contacts.

The big advantage to McAfee is the UNLIMITED devices. Norton is frequently a license for 3 or 5. If you have a household full of phones and Kindles and PC's (maybe not Apple stuff) this is a very good choice.",Not so hot for Apple iOS but VERY good value for multiple devices,1455667200

Installation of the software on the notebook went well, and I plugged the small GPS unit into a free USB port on my Asus put the netbook on the passenger seat and headed out.

The software interface feels dated; I wasn't entirely impressed with either the design or functionality.  Many functions weren't very intuitive, with multiple panes opening and closing providing different data.  Once I sorted it out and programmed my first trip in though, things got a bit easier.

The GPS unit picked up satellites quickly and easily, besting the GPS unit in my phone as well as a dedicated handheld Magellan unit I had brought for comparison.  My  trip progress was tracked accurately, with a readout of estimated mileage and ETA updated on the fly.  The major problem was finding things nearby.

With freestanding GPS units, it's easy to simply ask it to display nearby gas stations, hotels, etc.  However, there's no way to do this easily with S&T.  The only way to get that information is to go to the turn-by-turn list of directions, figure out which step you are near, select THAT, and then request nearby places of interest.  Not only wasn't it intuitive, it was useless to me: I used my G1 and its GPS unit for that functionality most of the time.  One other problem I had was a few software crashes. I was unable to determine if this was bad code or an underpowered netbook - though mine is easily able to run everything else I've thrown at it.

I suppose if you sat in a room and planned your trip, then loaded those trips as you traveled, this would work fine. Alternatively, if you had a navigator with you running the computer, you might be in ok shape, if not a bit puzzled at times by the interface.

But for use as a GPS on the fly while traveling solo, I'd give it a pass.  It just doesn't provide the ease of use or functionality I want in a GPS.","Good GPS Unit, OK For Planning, Not Great For On-The-Fly",1250553600

1144,4.0,True,"03 3, 2011",A21OGQWFAKGC41,1600775411,C. Robinson,"Before ordering this product directly from Amazon, I did my homework by posting comments in the comments sections of the most popular Amazon reviewers who have purchased and reviewed this product and other popular Spanish learning software.  After doing my homework, I finally decided to invest in this product.

Many people complain about the teaching method of this software but I think the problem is that many people are comparing this economically priced software with foreign language learning software that costs several hundred dollars.  If the price of this software were several hundred dollars, I would have probably only given it 1 star. But this software does not cost several hundred dollars and happens to be one of the most economically priced software programs available for learning a foreign language. At the very least, this software will teach you how to say and recognize a few hundred words. For that reason, I must give this software at least 4 stars.

Without a doubt, what I like most about this program is that it has lots of Spanish lessons at a very good price. The first level consists of 2 CDs that cover a lot of basic words and phrases that are helpful to know. And the second level also has 2 CDs that build on the words and phrases covered in Level 1 by giving the learner the tools to put together increasingly more complex sentences while ensuring that you are also learning proper pronunciation.  I found that the second level taught enough so that at the completion of the second level, the student should be able to string together basic phrase or sentences in order to converse about members of the family, sports, etc.

The third level which consisted of two CDs as well was my favorite level because it was the most challenging which is ideal for me because  I have been studying Spanish for quite a while. The actual conversations in the third level were a lot more challenging for me than the single vocabulary words covered in level 1 and the basic phrases covered in level 2. The third level also helped to reinforce what I learned in the other lessons.

There is a bonus CD with a game that comes with Immersion Spanish called Oscar On The Lake which I did not find fun at all.  I could have easily done without the Oscar On The Lake game. In fact, I don't see what was the point in including this Oscar On The Lake game with the program.

But I did find that the audio CD was very helpful. The audio CD thoroughly covered the alphabet, greetings, pronouns (including vosotros) conjugating AR, ER, and IR verbs, weather, numbers, and vocabulary for shopping and at the post office. What I liked most about the audio CD is that the instructor gave a lot grammatical explanations  including when the ""vos"" (as opposed to ""vosotros"") is used instead of the ""tu"" form.
One of the bonuses that I received with my Immersion Spanish software was in interactive DVD with Spanish learning games for the whole family. The DVD is can be used on the TV.  But I haven't had a chance to use the DVD because the 3 Levels consisting of 6 CDs and the audio CD, have enough to keep me busy for a quite a while.  One feature about Immersion Spanish the appeals to me is that the software can be used by both children and adults who want to learn Spanish.  Based on the product's price and the content, I recommend it.

Some other products that I recommend for Spanish language learners are Visual Link Spanish. This is a great  learning Spanish software program for the visual learner. Before I discovered&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Visual-Link-Spanish-Level-I/dp/B0000C08KK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Visual Link Spanish - Level I</a>, in all of my reviews I used to recommend Rosetta software. But after using Visual Link, it is clear to me that this software is a much better alternative for the visual learner. If you do not consider  yourself a visual learner, then&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fluenz-Version-F2-Spanish-1-2-3-4-5-with-supplemental-Audio-CDs-and-Podcasts/dp/B002ZF31NQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fluenz Version F2: Spanish 1+2+3+4+5 with supplemental Audio CDs and Podcasts</a>&nbsp;is probably the way to go.

To speak Spanish fluently besides having a stand alone course as your base and a method to learn new Spanish words, you will also need to master conjugating Spanish verbs. The best product for that is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verbarrator-Version-1-1-Windows-Version/dp/B002EADP1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verbarrator Version 1.1 (Windows Version)</a>&nbsp;software. The Verbarrator software does a great job of replacing the boring Spanish verb conjugation books and makes learning Spanish verbs enough fun that you will want to use the software every day. And the more you use the tool the quicker that you will learn how to conjugate Spanish verbs and reach fluency. The Verbarrator is probably the best investment that I have made in my journey to learn Spanish because it is a product that I use almost daily.

I've used Kaspersky for a few years and been very happy. Prior to that, I'd used Norton and McAfee, but both seem to have gone the way of bloatware. So, when Vine offered me this product, I wasn't really interested at first. I realized a bit later that my subscription was about to expire and that the newest version of my tried-and-true was getting panned in the reviews. (An altogether familiar tune after Norton and McAfee.) So I took the plunge.

It is fast, it seems to use fewer resources than even K2009 - and I thought that was a fast, light program. I've not had problems with it at all, though I've seen from other reviewers that the company seems to go above and beyond when users do experience issues.

One of the things about AV software is that it should make you forget it's working. It shouldn't make its presence known unless something has gone very wrong. It should be unobtrusive. Because of that, the best thing you should be able to say about a product in this category is that it works.

On a ranch, everyone pitches in. And really, the only thing you have to pitch in and do is collect eggs and vegetables, set up a camp fire, and feed the horses.

Actually, the camp fire was the only time I cheated, because I couldn't figure out where to get the kindling.

2) This is really a product for multiple WINDOWS devices, although you can add iOS and Android devices, but I wouldn't recommend it, especially on iOS devices.  iPhones, iPads, etc., really have their own set of protection services that makes Norton unnecessary.

Overall Thoughts

The Microsoft Office team did a great job of reconfiguring the Office 2010 menu/""ribbon"" feature that was introduced with Office 2007. The new ribbon is easier to customize and reduces the need to flip back and forth due to key functions being buried in the ribbon.
Power Point 2010

For a very long time the one thing that has been missing is the ability to embed video into a slide. Well they finally did it! You can embed video into your presentation if you would like. The thing that makes it a five star feature is that Microsoft has added the ability to edit the embedded video inside of the power point slide with no additional software needed. It's not a professional class video editing software package but it will get the job done and it is intuitive to use.

Another great feature of Power Point 2010 is the addition of a broadcast feature. You can now ""broadcast"" a presentation to people even if they do not have a copy of Office installed. All they need is a compatible web browser: Internet Explorer, Safari, or Firefox. This feature helps out tremendously with cross-platform compatibility issues.

Excel 2010

I use a lot of graphs in my job and the one thing I hated about Office 2007 was how difficult the ribbon system made making a chart with any customization, such as, layering two sets of data with two different vertical axis's. It was so difficult that it just flat stunk and made me long for Excel 2003. Excel 2010 makes that much easier, not perfect, but easier.

The most significant improvement is the addition of ""Spark"" lines. These are small ""micro"" graphs that are contained in a single cell. Each line of data can have its own micrograph and executive summary, very nice feature.

Outlook 2010

The look and feel of Outlook 2010 is more modern and less cluttered than its Office 2007 counter part. The absolute best feature that was added to Outlook 2010 is the preview feature for appointment/meeting requests. The new feature embeds a slice of your calendar into any meeting request and allows you to scroll through your calendar on the requested day and time to see if you wish to accept. No more switch from view to view in order to determine your availability. This has been a huge time saver.

OneNote

Office 2010 now comes standard with OneNote. I have used this product since its initial beta testing and it has become a mainstay for collecting data from meetings and customer research. The must have software group that has been missing for a while.

The one missing piece

I've been using Microsoft's Business Contact Manager for a few years now and I was very disappointed to see that it was not part of the disk version of Office 2010 Pro. In fact, in talking with friends that still work in IT they can't even figure out how to download or get the application off of Microsoft's site. This is after Microsoft made such a big deal out of the new features and how ""customizable"" the application was for the 2010 release. BCM is a great way for companies or entrepreneurs to have CRM (Customer Relationship Management) tools without spending a fortune on one of the enterprise packages such as [...] or Siebel. It's a big miss for the Office team.

For those that have been putting off upgrading because the value position from 2003 to 2007 was light; now is the time. You will get a much better product with 2010 when compared to Office 2003 or Office 2007.",Someone at Microsoft Must Have Been Listening,1284595200

The playback of DVDs is excellent. I have a Triple-core processor PC with 8GB of RAM and an ATI 512MB DDR3 video card, so the playback is smooth, as well as the forwarding and reverse. The graphical user interface (GUI) lets you control the player. The PowerDVD player opens and begins playing DVD's automatically when you close your optical drive. Fast-forward and reverse speeds include: 1.2x, 1.5x, 2x (all three with sound), and the remaining without sound, 3x, 4x, 8x, 16x, 32x.  Slow-motion speeds include: 0.5x and 0.75x with sound. Advancing forward frame-by-frame is smooth, but advancing in reverse isn't smooth. I can't comment on the Blu-ray or 3D abilities yet since I have not tested them.

The player allows you to capture frames of any scene by using the soft-remote. Specify the location in the preferences.  You can also use your smartphone as a remote by installing the PowerDVD remote software on the smartphone and entering the passcode provided in the main window under Devices. You need to download the app for Android or iPhone from the website first. There are some free versions, and other versions for $20.  PowerDVD also lets you view your videos and photos contained on your smart-device.

Options allow you to use hardware acceleration if needed, especially if you want to watch 3D or Blu-ray movies.  Another option available is the ability to use True Theater Effects for cinematic lighting, but I don't use it since my monitor gets the lighting right without it. Additional options let you choose speaker configurations and HD audio output for that full audio experience.  And lastly, you can add your own voice-over and karaoke too.

The first time you run the software, it will ask for the CD Key to activate on your PC. I did not have any issues with activation. I have not had to deal with customer service either.
I recommend updating any video drivers for your video card if necessary. This software has been running without issue for me. But it all depends on your computer specs and video card, and some people's experiences may be different.  The PowerDVD main window has multiple tabs for Movie, Video, Photo, Music Devices, so you can watch other video clips you have on your hard drive, view your photo galleries, or listen to your music library. The software automatically obtains detailed information about movies, and ratings from online if you are connected, but it seemed pointless and useless to me.

Included in the box is the installation DVD and a 100 page, fully-detailed instruction manual.  The installation took less than 5 minutes.  For DVD movies and DVD-R discs, this software works

First, I'd like to start by dividing my review into two factions.
1) The game itself
2) My personal detective work.

* PART 1 *

PLOT: A San Francisco trip that involves Nancy helping out her housekeeper [Hannah Gruen] who has a friend, Rose, trying to renovate a mansion that would convert into a B & B.  Trouble is, after  vandalism acts threaten the construction efforts, Rose is worried that her life's investment is on the verge of failure.  Can Nancy Drew figure out what these ghostly noises and spectral appearances mean?

INITIAL SCORE: 94

CHARACTERS:

Rose Green: She was very businesslike and wrapped herself up in her financial problems, especially with the insurance company.  She gave ND a couple renovation projects, but nothing that was overwhelming. She wasn't  fascinating to talk too on the whole though and I found her personal help rather limited.

Abby Sideris: After I read that article in the local paper about how  B & B's thrive on uniqueness in order to survive the glut of similar businesses opening up, I knew that her involvement in the supernatural was most likely orchestrated as a marketing venture.  This was confirmed early on in the game so my view on her being a culprit in the vandalism wasn't making sense for me.

Charlie Murphy: [voiced as Ned Nickerson in later games] The typical handsome renovation guy who is friendly to talk too, but abruptly severs conversation concerning the mansion problems.  That is strange. Something told me he wasn't the culprit, however.

Louis Chandler: I had a feeling he was the culprit, but also respected his expertise on the Victorian period decor regarding the mansion.

Hannah & Emily: I was glad to have a chance to speak to Hannah although I thought the voice acting for both characters were horrible. It sounded as if a younger voice was trying to mimic a senior or adult.  I think HER should have hired a professional to suit this part.

CUMUL SCORE: - 4 = 90

SCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:
I enjoyed the trickery of the scary voices "" I see you!"" and the manic laughing from the hidden speakers, but I could not get into the mood because, frankly, this does not look like a creepy house.  I was not unnerved like a lot of the kids playing this game were, so the ""Haunted"" aspect fell flat on me.  The ghostly apparitions were cool to witness though for graphics that were clearly dated.  The score was just okay.

CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 89

PUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: The Hanzi [Chinese symbols] weren't understood until I was halfway through the adventure and learned that they were needed for future puzzles.  That being said, there weren't any puzzles that were overwhelming to me; nothing that had me bogged down in contemplation.  There was nothing outstanding, but this is not meant to say that this game was without its intrigue.

CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 88

ADVENTURE ENDING: I found it odd that I couldn't solve the main hall confrontation by moving LEFT up the stairs, I had to move RIGHT. I don't understand the need for that.  The culprit was obvious without any plot trickery.  Abby's plan to draw in customers apparently was condoned afterward, because she had previously invested in the B & B.  This ending was a precursor to Shadow Ranch since the plots were virtually the same. I noticed a misspelling in the dialogue [I think with Emily]. HER should clean that up.

CUMUL SCORE: - 2 = 86

* PART 2 *

I try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to
take weeks! Well, it took me three days [9 hours] and I gave myself a
Detective Score Of : 74

My Strong Points: I guessed the culprit and have been on quite a run lately [13 correct out of 20 games].  I seemed to assimilate into the plot pretty well without being fooled into believing any side story that would skew my detective work.

My Weak Points: I had to seek the walkthrough twice only because I didn't want to burn a few hours wandering around the trippy interface finding out what to do next. It cost me a few points, but it was worth it :).

OVERALL GAME SCORE: 86 + 74/ 2 = 80 [ B - ]

BOTTOMLINE: I see the progress of the ND games expanding and there is a nice future ahead, but the HER staff needs to clean up the dialogue glitches. Tasks were completed, but proceeding conversations acted as if I hadn't started them yet. A good buy for $ 3.

USE: while using the product takes a little time to figure out, it is generally easy. follow the workout charts they give you. the door attachment is a cool addition and is also generally easy to use, also widens the range of workouts available from the product. this level of resistance is perfect for me being a larger male, on some exercises it is a little weak so make sure you can estimate your strength before ordering. the door attachment can be tricky to install. make sure the door is CLOSED when you install it, otherwise could result in a flying object to the face.

PRODUCT: in reading the reviews, some people have had the product break on them within the first several uses. I haven't noticed any indication of weakness, seems to be well constructed but i will be looking out for this.

Note: IronMind's delivery was flawless, very fast, zero problems with them. Highly recommended.

Background: I've been going to the gym for at least 10 years. This doesn't mean I'm a body builder or anything even close to that, it just means I've hit weights for a long time. I never really trained my forearms so  I would say I have an average grip, meaning, average for someone who at least goes to the gym. If you've never done weights or rock climbing etc, this is not the gripper for you, start with something easier and work your way up.

First Impression: They are solid. The metal is a little harsh to the hand, but, let's be honest, if you want more gripping power you probably want your hands to show it, you don't want soft hands, so, see no big deal with it. Your hands will get used to it and will benefit from the calluses.

First time use: Closed it five times with my dominant hand, zero times with the non-dominant. Now, I mean close as in a bona-fide close, where the handles touch, none of that ""almost closed it"" story.

Conclusion (for now): They are definitely a good investment, the metal feels like it'll last a lifetime. If you think the #1 is too hard for you, follow your instinct, it probably is, start with the trainer. I've never been a fan of doing a 1,000 reps so this is exactly what I wanted, few reps of raw power, so it works for me.

Great price for a camp stove, in general, and especially one of this quality.
Looks like something made to last 20+ years.
Could see this used on a cattle drive.

I was looking for something for emergency situations where there is no power.
I looked at barbecues, but wondered how I would cook something in a pan for a 'normal' meal.
I then fell over 'camp stoves'; I found this one by Camp Chef that was highly recommended everywhere I looked.
Amazon had it at a good price.
I think it is made in USA as well.
I bought it; happy I did.

So, how did it work out?
I tried it out the other day to make sure it worked - and for fun.
I used a new cast iron skillet for cooking (Lodge 10.5 inch) since this thing can generate a lot of heat.
Simple to set up.
Easy to use.
More than enough heat to cook anything you want.
Nice basic unit.
Cooked my meal with a smile on my face.
Very happy with this unit.

Legs easily go on and come off.
Can take this with you anywhere you might want to go.
Many accessories for it.
I love it!

Now, even though I originally wanted it for emergency situations, I can see using it to cook for picnics or just be outside on hot days.

1237,4.0,False,"07 12, 2003",A33TZR3VQJMKIZ,B00005N9DR,Pruitt Hall,"Truly a 'niche' product, the Suunto Observer defies classification.  It's a sport watch, make no mistake, but Casio's line (particularly the 'G-Shocks') offer more for the money and MUCH increased battery life.  It's several 'instruments' rolled into one, offering barometer, altimeter, compass and thermometer, but in a watch case, and, surprisingly, blending them into an attractive package.
If you're considering this 'wrist computer' (Suunto's term and fairly appropriate) for a 'techno' toy though, save your money.  Typical of Suunto's products, it has stellar thinking behind it.  Typical also it is cutting edge.  However, also typical of products built and produced in Finland, it has an owner's manual that has to be about a 5 to 10 on the readability scale of a 100.  Like all Scandinavian products, there is a concerted effort here to use icons whenever possible and it's like you walked into a Russian made helicopter; there may be icons, but you're still going to have to have someone explain it to you!  But, like Suunto's diving gauges, one you cross the divide and spend some quality time with the manual, user reviews, internet postings and about 6 to 10 hours playing with it, you WILL have a grin on your face.  It's an outstanding piece of technology, but only once you finally understand it.
A few points that may help you:
--I bought the stainless model (there is also a full rubber strap model and a titanium model).  Realize it IS NOT a full stainless strap; it's a rubber strap with about 10 pieces of stainless for looks only.  However, unlike some reviews posted, I truly LIKE the look and don't feel Suunto was cheesing out by just using stainless 'pieces' instead of a full stainless strap.  It fits like a glove, once adjusted.  It took me about 30 minutes to fit it perfectly.
--Other reviews give a hit or miss coverage of the DUAL opening latch on the strap.  It does have 2 openings, the second is to give additional access if you have large hands/small wrists.  One review stated, incorrectly, that the second latch undermines the first latches ability to hold it together tightly.  If they would have examined the second latch in more detail, they would see that the primary latch COVERS the second with a gate, preventing it from opening.  IN NO WAY does the second latch make this strap less strong.  Typical Suunto, well engineered, but poorly documented.
--Carefully read one reviewer's lengthy discussion about how the barometric pressure and altitude settings work.  They went into GREAT detail (more than I will here) covering how these two systems are interrelated and connected.  Once you finally grasp it, it makes sense.  For a summary, just remember this:  When in camp, use the barometric setting; it will be very accurate when you do this.  When on the trail, use the altitude setting.  It's as simple as that.
--Some reviewers stated that the systems (any or all) aren't terribly accurate.  WRONG.  They are accurate.  I've compared the barometer and altimeter to dedicated systems I have and they're very, very close.  The compass matches a Brunton transit within a few degrees.  Take the time to learn how to use them and they're very handy and very accurate.
--One reviewer stated that the battery life on the Casio's is far superior to the Suunto (even I did at the start of this review).  That IS an accurate statement.  What they left out though, is that the Suunto has an EASILY replaced battery that doesn't require the back of the watch to come off (Casio's DO require the back to be removed).  So it's a toss up.  I find on my Casio's that with regular backlight use, they get eaten up pretty quickly too.  Realize, Casio only rates their batteries at ONE use of the backlight per day, and who only uses a backlight once a day?  On their top rated G-Shock (which I also own) the battery life drops 2 YEARS when you use the backlight just twice a day.  I'll take Suunto's approach any day; just use a dime to remove a separate cover for the battery and you're back in business.
--The Suunto has one thing no Casio has--it's stylish.  Very European/high tech looking and built like a tank too.  Make no mistake, I'll still wear my Casio if I'm diving, because I don't want to scratch the Suunto (kind of crazy isn't it?  I'm not concerned about my Suunto dive gauges, lol).
So I'm giving the Suunto four stars; was considering three for the STEEP learning curve, but after I finally 'got it' I was grinning like a Cheshire cat.  It is really a fun instrument to play with and truly does offer features in a unique package.  Highly recommended, but don't buy it if you aren't willing to spend the time learning its nuances.  One last note and one that helped me the most.  I was frustrated with Suunto's labels of the buttons and finally adopted Casio's system that I kludged together.  This watch has 4 buttons.  De-program yourself from thinking of them in Suunto's terms.  Use Casio's EXCELLENT system of calling the buttons A,B,C and D.  Just make a little cheat sheat that corresponds to A,B,C and D. A is top left, B is top right, C is bottom left and D is bottom right.  Once you convert Suunto's system to Casio's, it is SO much easier!

(So, I can't comment on jam fixes, but it is easy to remove the nosepiece, without tools.)  This nailer has a slight ""recoil"".  If it isn't pushed into the work AND the wood is fairly hard, the staple won't go in all the way.  This is because part of the drive force is spent pushing the tool away from the staple.  The same thing would probably happen with any large stapler.  For the most part, the staple head is about flush with the surface, and of course, power is adjustable via the regulator.

Overall, the productivity gained by using this powerhouse is incredible.  My speed was about 1 staple per second, but I took my time.  Although one hand control is workable, I used both hands most of the time, in order to ensure the staple was fully driven home.

I also bought the 7/16"" x 2"" staples from Amazon, and they stay in.  In fact, be sure you're driving staples where you won't change your mind.  In the cases where a staple had to be removed, I couldn't pull them out.  Wound up cutting the tops off.  Almost like driving a double nail with each trigger pull.  That's holding power.

1272,2.0,False,"11 4, 2003",A2JAEZ0FMAMJVW,B00004YNWW,A. H.,"I owned a DeWalt 705S for a bit more than a week before returning it. For about five years, I owned a starter model Craftsman 10"" miter saw, which was fine for simple 45 degree miters and straight cuts for small projects; however, even after extensive adjustments, it never would cut a straight bevel (probably due to lateral weakness in the arm, among other things). Because I was getting ready to do some extensive remodeling and trim work, I decided it was time to replace the Craftsman with a more serious saw.
I looked around at various saws and picked up the DeWalt. I like to buy American made tools when possible, and that was one of the factors in the decision. The DeWalt does have a nice, smooth action and is fairly solid overall, much better than the Craftsman it was replacing. I have had good experiences with other DeWalt power tools I own (e.g., a circular saw and a drill). After using this saw for a few days, though, I noticed problems. The worst of them is that the locking mechanism is terribly designed on this unit. Other reviewers on this site have noted this (and I wish I'd read their reviews before buying the saw!). The problem is this: when you lock in a miter setting by cranking the knob, the pressure lifts the rotating miter table relative to the ""fixed"" base of the saw. The table even lifts a bit when you set the saw to a pre-slotted angle; the spring that settles into the detent also pushes the table upwards and out of square.
Now, this may not be an issue for you if you are making straight cuts in 2x4s or building a dog house, but it is a big problem if you're trying to do fine trim work where accuracy really matters. The defect effectively throws off the angles you're dialing in.
At this price point, I don't think a saw should have slop engineered into it. This DeWalt unfortunately does and is therefore an inferior product in my book. (Even the flawed Craftsman saw I had did not have the table accuracy issue that this saw does.) DeWalt customer service offered me no solutions or workarounds and suggested I return the product if I wasn't satisfied. Back to the home center it went. And I did check the display model for this particular issue after I returned the saw. The display model had the exact same issue. Just tighten the knob and watch the table go up. It's even worse when you have the miter set to 45 degrees, where you can really see the contrast between the table and the base after the table rises. DeWalt just doesn't seem to have been able to figure out how to set the table solidly in the base.
After shopping around again and reading more extensive reviews, I picked up a Delta TwinLaser 36-255L instead. Though it is a Taiwanese saw (as most appear to be), it is dead on accurate and needed minimal adjustments out of the box. (To be fair, the DeWalt was fairly well set up from the factory and did not require more than about fifteen minutes of work to get it squared up.)

It also enhances the surface area moderately, thereby adding some strength. For further strength, use it in conjunction with biscuits. I had bought this Freud reversible glue up joint bit as part of a cabinet set.
The problem is getting the glue seams on multiple boards to sit flush. Normally when clamping, one board might sit a little higher, or lower than the one next to it. Clamping is of course an answer, but is only effective if you clamp the heck out of nearly the entire surface.
If you are fortunate enough to own a huge drum or belt sanding stationary machine, you enjoy the advantage of being able to pass your table top through the sander to level the edges. Since most of us don't have that advantage, it would be reassuring to know that the irregular face of the bit forces the alignment of the individual boards.
You must take the time to get the registration right. To prep to use this bit, is to plane the boards, all at the same time, to a final even thickness, and then used the reversible glue up joint bit, you would wind up with a table top that would only need a light sanding.
From what I see, most people are considering this bit to be an alternative to biscuit joinery. Although I admit that you are slightly increasing the amount of board surface to glue up, it is not really significant enough to make a substantial difference in the strength of the joint. It appears that the finger joint bit would do the job of increasing surface area a little better.
The advantage of the Frued glue joint bit, is that it will give you a perfect alignment of the boards. In plain words, a flat top without irregular seam ridges to try and sand out.

 In conclusion, use this glue up joint bit to align your boards, and mildly enhance the glue surface. Adding biscuits would give you even more strength.
Hope this helps.",Glue joint bit excellent for aligning board surfaces.,1044489600

The Westmister Chime is the default ring-tone and it sounds real nice.  My Dad really likes the way it plays, and he won't be missing the doorbell any more.

One thing that did disappoint me was that if you wanted to select something other than Westmister Chime, it wasn't overly easy to do.  I expected there to be a switch or something that you would switch to select the different tones, but you actually have to go up to the part that is mounted over your wall mounted doorbell and pull these little things off and put them in a different pattern to select a new tone.  If you look closely at the photo of the smaller part with the wires, you'll be able to see what I mean.

This blade runs so true I immediately noticed my saw was running quieter. The cuts feel like I sanded them with 320 grit paper, and chip out is virtually nonexistent. This blade actually produces finer cuts than my guillotine style molding chopper. I have put off purchasing such an expensive blade for a long time, but I am completely satisfied with this blade, and feel it's money well spent. Time will tell just how long it will last, but from the other reviews I've read, it should be a good long time. Cutting real hardwood as opposed to composites will certainly help.

update 2-28-13

I mentioned in my review time will tell how long it will last. The answer in my case was about 400 cuts. I am now noticing some find chipping in molding finishes. I have cut nothing but hardwood molding (actually most molding is Luan), so pretty soft stuff. I tried to contact Forrest to inquire about blade sharpening, but got no response. I am now going to order a Quinn 100 tooth blade. They are considerably less money, and have a 107 year history.  Customer service seems to be top-notch. Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent blade, but I do question whether it's worth the money, particularly after needing a sharpening after only 400 cuts. That's basically five cents a cut.

Three rolling pins, smooth, grooved, and grid-patterned, allow creativity to blossom.  Five molding blocks and a crimping roller, as well as four small containers, with lids incorporating animal molds, of modeling dough complete the set.  All pieces are contained in a handy wooden tray.

Like other Melissa & Doug toys, the ""Shape, Model & Mold"" set is an outstanding concept that could use some refinement.  Constructed in China of less expensive wood, the finish work on the wood rolling pins and molding blocks needs improvement.  The grooved rolling pin, in particular, has rough projections/burrs that need to be sanded down - a Dremel tool will probably do the trick.  Some of the splintered cut extends into the groove so that a child is unable to get a ""straight"" line when rolling the pin through dough.  The red block is particularly bad on the set I received; firring of the wood completely alters the intended dome-shape.  Using tools in his shop, ""Papa"" will be able to correct the flaws - were this not the case, I would have returned the ""Melissa & Doug Shape Model and Mold"" set I received as defective.

The dough in the containers was a bit crumbly and will not last; my daughter had the same issue with the set she purchased last year.  However, I purchased this specifically for the variety of tools and molds, so the dough's condition did not factor into my rating.

My grandson loves the ""Melissa &  Doug Shape, Model and Mold"" set he has at home and at Grandma's.  If you can fix flaws or if you are fortunate enough to receive a set without them, you will like this toy to use with clay or Play-doh.

I played it about 4 years ago. Black Isle strikes again

with a fantastic game ...

You can only play one character (the nameless one) but he is

super cool. He NEVER dies! lol ... well he can but then he gets back up again and ready to fight again. So, you can't actually get killed for good in this game.

You can join up with several NPC's, one being a floating skull

named, Morte. He is very cool to have around and is very powerful in high levels. There is even a somewhat romance for

the main character ... she's got a tail (laughs) and she is very neat to have around.

The graphics are superb, the storyline is one of the best I've seen and the combat system I just loved. Very easy to use controls and has dungeon crawl galore.

It's been awhile since I actually played it, but if I remember right, you can play 3 different classes. A fighter, a thief or a mage. The fighter class is by far the best one to go with.

You basically start out in a dungeon, lying on a hospital table, and then are greeted by Morte who will help you get started with how the game works, your fighting, journal, etc. He will then join up with you and help you escape the place. There is much to do right from the beginning, trying to escape. I don't wanna give away too much, because it is a very awesome storyline.

I will add however, as the story unfolds your character finds out more about himself. Why is is there and what lies ahead for him. It's hard to explain, but I am sure you will love it.

Give it a try, you will not regret it.

Also has a nice modding community on sorcerers.net.

The graphics are great as most people have pointed out, but there is just no gameplay at all. Rather than giving us a ""living, breathing world to explore"", the actualy in-game world is completely linear. Rather than giving us a variety of quests we just click on monsters, kill them and get treasure. Sure there are four different ways to kill them (melee, ranged, combat magic and nature magic) but a RPG that does not make. Many comparisons have been made to Diablo 2, but in terms of gameplay his is almost a step backward. There are fewer skills and spells than Diablo 2, and unlimited ammo for bows makes the game oddly unbalanced. There are several other minor issues but I won't go into detail. These include restricted camera movement, the overhead map being too small, strange behaviour at level-up meaning that your character suddenly cant cast spells, dodgy AI etc but I guess most of these will be fixed in a patch sooner or later. As per most modern games, you can create mods and Dungeon Seige uses the Seige Editor and the GMax 3d system from Discreet (a cut down version of the popular 3D Studio Max system).

This game was made by EA, (not Rare Ware) so it wasn't the same people who did GoldenEye or Perfect Dark. But the guys at EA sure know how to make great games too, and this game is an excellent first-person shooter (fps). You'll run around using many cool weapons and Q-gadgets (like the Q-claw, Q-laser, Q-specs, Q-jet, etc.) The levels span all across the globe, and they're all very graphically pleasing. In most levels there is more emphasis on shooting than stealth, but you'll  have to sneak around every now and again. And the single player mode isn't just a first-person shooter, it has driving and shooting levels to add variation. In some levels you will find yourself poking out of the rooftop of a car or tank, shooting at tons of enemies (you control the shooting, not the actual car movement). Then there are levels where you actually race through cities in Bond's awesome cars (BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB5, etc), which of course are modified with awesome Q-gadgets (like missiles, oil slicks, Q-pulse, etc). Both the shooting and driving levels are really fun, and add alot to the single-player experience. You will also be able to unlock special items by getting high scores in levels, which just adds to the single-player replay value. But with first-person shooters the serious replay value comes with multiplayer...
I can't even begin to convey the utter joy i've had playing 007: Agent Under Fire multiplayer with 3 friends. First of all- you can use the Q-jet and Q-claw in multiplayer, which is so awesome. The Q-claw in particular has changed the whole face of fps multiplayer. Instead of just running on the ground shooting other people, you can use the Q-claw to fly around like SpiderMan, which adds the whole vertical dimension to each level. It's basically an incredible grappling hook that sticks to anything (if you hold the button down you can stay where you are), so you can shoot yourself up high and just hang there to assasinate people. Eventually me and my friends got so good we were using the Q-claw to get around everywhere, flying across each level, shooting rocket lanchers as we made passes at each other. If you haven't tried this yet then you're missing out on some of the best fun you'll ever have playing any game (seriously). Just try the Castle level with Rocket Launchers and the Q-claw (also- use controller setup 4 for multiplayer, this is the best setup and the only one that works perfectly with the Q-claw and jet). There are also other multiplayer modes like: Protect the Flag, Golden Gun, Anti-Terrorist Training, and Top Agent. There's an escort level too, which is basically a multiplayer sniper mode (really cool). Plus you can even put computer bots in multiplayer matches. But the catch is- only four players can play at a time, which includes bots (so if there are 2 human players you can put in 2 computer bots, if there are 4 human players you cant put any bots!) All-in-all this game is superb, even if it does have a few minor shortcomings (more bots and some blood would have been nice). I can certainly recommend this game as being worth a [money] purchase, the Q-Claw multiplayer alone makes it worth the money, not too mention all the excellent single-player levels and gameplay modes.

Medal of Honor: Frontline proves that no matter how you dress up a first person shooter, at it's core Frontline is basically the same as most other first person shooter games. The game degenerates into the same static formula of running around and arbitrarily blowing away the enemy the only difference is you are doing it in a World War II setting.
The graphics in this game are terrific. It's almost too bad they are used in a game that gets this monotonous. The Nazi uniforms are very accurate and detailed. The environments are nicely rendered. There is the occasional slowdown where the framerate slows to a crawl but that's is forgiveable. Electronic Arts really went the extra mile to make sure that this game authentically portrayed the era as faithfully as possible. The sound is also very well done. The weapons have great sounds when you use them. Glass breaking, footsteps on creaky floors. The game gives you some excellent audio effects. The controls are also good but they will take you a little while to get the handle of using both analog sticks to aim.
Unfortunately it's the gameplay that leaves something to be desired from Medal of Honor: Frontline. No matter how hard you try to dress it up, the game play is extremely repetitive an mind numbingly so. No matter what weapon you use, it doesn't change the fact that you are doing the same thing over and over again. Alot of people who play first person shooter games will tell you that it's ""more realistic"", but it comes at the expense of gameplay. If this game were presented in third person perspective I can't help but think that it could have opened the door for more diverse gameplay. Such as commanding squads and even some stealth elements. But there are certain segments of the gaming public that would consider such an idea as ""blasphemous"" as if it were violating some sort of FPS doctrine. With that mindset you get what you have here, basically the same game as countless other FPS out there now just in a differnt package. The game is also VERY linear in nature. You go from Point A to Point B with no deviation and with zero room to improvise along the way.
I gave this game three stars mostly for it's graphics, however I still can't recomend it. If you're looking for a different take on the shooter concept then I would have to recomend Freedom Fighters also from Electronic Arts. It takes combat shooter a step further by giving you a third person view and mixing in squad commands and a non-linear style of gameplay.","Great graphics, cool setting, repetitive gameplay",1072915200

Its true that this game has received way too much hype for what it really is. It is not true that this game is the best FPS game ever made, infact it doesn't even come close.
 Halo is basicly Quake III, Red Faction, Aliens vs. Pred 2, and Half-Life all rolled into one game. The big difference is that for the Video Gaming industry, Halo was the best thing people had ever seen before, but for the PC Gaming industry, Halo was just another space first-person shooter.
 If I were to rate this game on the basis of the PC it would only get 3 stars, but from the X-Box perspective its an O.K. game. Infact its pretty damn fun once you get into playing it in multiplayer mode. Even single player mode deserves praise with a some-what interactive environment. Co-operative play is by far the most fun however if you only have 2 or 3 people playing the game. Adversal multiplay doesn't really pick up until you have atleast 4 players.
 One thing that is a big plus but also a minus is that you get to drive vehicles such as 4v4's, tanks, and a small handful of hover craft in this game. The bad part is that the driving physics for half the vehicles are questionable at the very least. The 4v4 is by far the worst handling of all and takes skill, luck, and patience to get the hang of. But if you have 3 human players in the 4v4 at the same time, you feel like a team.
The graphics for this game are beautiful and the sounds are rich and clear. Some of the missions are a little pointless and annoying, but if you get past them its fun again. The controls are fairly easy to get the hang of once you play for awhile, but the double control stick way of moving and looking around is a bit of a strugle to get the hang of.
Game atmosphere and level design are both high scoring with all types of level formats and styles. The atmosphere runs higher when playing higher difficulties, but its fun either way.
Bottom line: Halo is still an over rated game, but it is a fair bet, and if you like FPS games of the Quake/Red Faction era you should enjoy this game.

Music: What was in-house early 90's mediocre electronica in the original, 2097/XL sported a healthy soundtrack that spawned an actual CD release in stores along with a 2x12 vinyl version as well. With names like Photek, Fluke, Future Sound of London, Chemical Brothers and Underworld it was a snapshot of what popular electronic music was like in the late 90's, but it didn't have that extremely dated sound. The additional tracks on the CD/Vinyl Soundtrack by Leftfield, Orbital and Source Direct were the icing on the cake.

Graphics: Heavily upgraded since Wipeout, 2097/XL's graphics were sharp, well detailed and helped immerse you into the game. Colors radiated from teh screen vs the drab dead colors from the previous game. The visuals by The Designers Republic [tDR] helped give the game that distinct feel that many other racing games lacked. No other game had design flavor that this did and it really did help give this game an identity that more or less shaped the way it would be presented in the future. Where WO was alien and somewhat lifeless, and Wipeout3 was almost atmospheric and bright, this had a dark and gritty feeling.

Gameplay: The controls were touched up so the ship didn't bounce anymore, it seemed to glide effortlessly on the tracks. When you picked up speed, you sat on the edge of your seat trying not to touch the wall. The ship responded exactly the way you wanted it to.

Bonus: There was a code you could put in where you could change the ships to different things. LIke one was a swimming shark, one was a bumblebee, and my personal favorite, the Pirhana [unlockable ship after so many gold medals] could be changed into a little pickle fying a space ship that had a minigun on it with unlimited ammo. I would blow up every competitor with in 2 laps just from that gun alone.

I went into it thinking it was more of a role player or strategy game but after many hours in realize it has all of those and more. For some reason codemasters the devs stopped this one after the Red River series...still scratching my noggin over that one...but found a link on their site that took me to a euro site that is alive and well and even has 152 missions that can be used over and above the ones that initially came with the game with more to follow. Now you just can't beat that. You can play co-op or multi-player and the single-player has a good 12 to 18 hrs worth and for the modest prices you can pick this one up for and if you like the genre you owe it to yourself to give it a whirl. It was released in 2009 so the graphics are very decent and it doesn't tax your graphics card to boot. It's a stand alone so you don't need Steam or Origin to play it. I would give it five stars but there are a few minor glitches like loosing your cursor motion at times but alt tab out or reboot and it comes right back and off ya go again. Again for what their asking prices these days are and you have friends that like the same stuff this is a fun game to play on line in LAN mode. Keep in mind also that there all sorts of ways to skin the cat in this game which makes for challenging ways to defeat the AI's, maps are fairly large with all sorts of ways to go about winning each mission which there are ten with seven extra missions inside the game once you complete the first ten. If you get hung up do as I and go to IGN walkthrough and it'll help tremendously.

***UPDATE***3/10/2013  There are a number of folks that have added quite a few maps there are two patches 1.01 and 1.02 that add two DLC's and there is another fellow found on the codemasters site that has added 152 more maps that are really challenging.

Even though it is advertised as being based on a Joint Chiefs of Staff training game, Simon and Schuster Interactive has put out a highly inaccurate game with poor replay value.  The most intriguing part of this game is its storyline, an all-too current battle of America versus terrorists.  That's where the comparison stops.  Unlike the Al-Qaeda, the Real War's evil-doer's, Independent Liberation Army, have access to Tomahawk missile launching Cruisers, Attack Aircraft Carriers, and seemingly limitless ground assets of moderate complexity.
  The saving grace for this game is its interface.  It is easy to zoom in and out to keep track of you units.  This game is best enjoyed by your seven-year old nephew who does not have a grasp of the destuctiveness of modern weapons.  Case in pont, it is entertaining watching an infantry unit sprint Carl Lewis-like in the open past a Light Armored Vehicle (LAV) with .50 caliber machine firing away.  The infantryman will typically last 20-30 seconds.  Moreover, tanks blast away at each other often sustaining more than three or four direct hits before there armor gives way.  Lastly, a missile from a cruiser will hit a helicopter or plane and do only moderate damage.  The weapons effects are higly innacurate and remove all doubt as to the overall quality of this game.
  Sadly, Red Alert is still the most accurate game at combining joint land, sea, and air units.

This game looks great but doesn't play very well.  The concept is along the lines of a deathmatch.  You choose a mode of play; team play, boss attack or deathmatch, then pick a character and level.  Gameplay consists of running around wonderfully designed levels shooting, blowing up, and slicing apart your oponents.  All of the popular characters from the comic book are here, and some of the levels might be familiar to a few fans too.
The graphics are absolutly mind blowing.  Some of the best graphics I have seen on the Dreamcast to date.  The characters are highly detailed and the level design is wonderful.  After you pick your jaw off the ground and grab the controler to start playing things begin to go down hill.  The controls for this game are not very user friendly at all, and the camera angles are going to frustrate just about everyone who plays it.  You aim with the analog stick and move with the digital pad, all while using the buttons to jump and change weapons.  If we all had three hands it might work but for those of us with only two, it is very frustrating.
Overall the game is alright, wonderful graphics but horible controls.  Single player can get a bit old fast but this game is a lot of fun with someone to spar off against.

And as you may know, they filmed actual people to do the moves in the game to give it a realistic look, well they originally wanted Jean Claude to be Johny Cage. You may have noticed Johny Cage wearing the exact same outfit as Van Damme did in the movie, and also having the same moves, mainly the splits nut shot. Anyways, Van Damme turned the role down due to other obligations, but I found it very interesting anyways.

Lets be honest, the actual fighting in Mortal Kombat is not really good. Its not fast paced and does not require much use of tactics. Street Fighter had it beat in that department.

As critics and gamers alike have said before, everything you thought was missing from Goldeneye is in Perfect Dark. The attention to detail surpasses that of Goldeneye by far, and the gameplay (with the help of the RAM Expansion of course) is twice as smooth.
How do you describe this game? Think ""Tomb Raider"" meets ""GoldenEye"" meets ""The X-Files,"" and there you have it. You are Joanna Dark, a top agent with elite Carrington Institute, researching and investigating the mysterious DataDyne Corporation and thier evil conspiracy to assist an alien invasion. Gameplay is very similar to Goldeneye, moving, targeting, shooting, and using items will be all to familiar for fans of the 1997 calssic. The new weapons, ranging from small handguns, to automatic hand-cannons, to alien x-ray guns (The ""Far-Sight"" gun is so much fun it's silly), are fun to use, and much more useful as well. Each weapon has a primary and secondary function. For example, proximity mines have a secondary function to act as a homing device for proximity mines and other hidden threats.
Multiplayer levels have me thoroughly amazed. There are several new multiplayer arenas, and two classics from Goldeneye (the Complex and the Temple - each with a few new surprises). The new Arenas are incredbile, ranging from huge mazes that make The Classic Complex look not so complex; to smaller arenas for the fans of the Basement and Archives levels in Goldeneye. You also have the option of adding any number of computer-controlled players of several different skill levels to add to the challenge. The high tech weapons with all their new gadgetry make the game really fun to play in multiplayer mode.
Solo missions follow a gripping storyline filled with conspiracy, intrigue, espionage, and yes, science fiction. Your battles take place on Air Force One, deep beneath the desert at Area 51, under the ocean aboard alien vessels, and deep within alien ruins. Newer puzzles, obstacles, and secrets await you in just about every level. The dialogue adds to the realism of the game, both during play, and between levels in detailed cut-scenes which develop the overall story. But be advised, this game is rated ""M,"" so the graphics and dialogue are not recommended for our younger players.
Of all the new features, my favorite is the new CoOperative Missions option. That's right, now you can complete a level as a team via split-screen during what would normally be a solo mission. (Imagine how much easier this would have made the Control Room mission in GoldenEye, with an extra person to watch your back and Natalia's!). Likewise, you can play ConterOperative missions as well, and play against each other during a mission. This is just as much fun as normal multiplayer, except now you are part of the story as well.
This is a great game! If you are trying to decide between this, and the new Bond game then buy this one. It is MUCH better than ""The World is Not Enough"" in every possible aspect. The weapons, the levels, the gameplay, and the graphics cannot compare! If you liked GoldenEye, you'll LOVE this game.",007 Meets his Match?,977184000

I played Arcanum, and fell in love with its combination of action, storytelling, and sheer freedom.
THE GOODS:
This game has an original and engrossing story, complete with great dialogue and written items the main character finds. There is unrivalled variety when creating and advancing your character. The game does a great job at balancing the effectiveness of magic and technology. The game gives the player a surprising amount of control in how the main character develops. Will the protagonist become a great hero (or despicable thief)? A crusader against technology (or magic)? A hero loved by the people (or villains)? The protagonist can be some of these things, or none of them, but not all. One thing I love about this game is how, if you choose sides, there will be consequences to your choosing. Do you take the side of the wizard being disrupted by the local steam engine, or an engineer, trying to keep his machines (and self) safe with saboteurs lurking about? Or will you avoid the situation? This game offers even more freedom than Fallout/Fallout 2 did.
THE BADS:
There are decently long load times, which can be frustrating if you're a person who does not like to be kept waiting.

First thing that amazed me about it was how the game looked graphically, I've seen alot of beautiful games on the PS2 and this is, by far, the best one I've seen on the system yet. Everything is colorful, vibrant, and, at times, literally breathtaking. The game itself takes a 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' approach, meaning there's really nothing innovative or new to the game...it's basically like Crash Team Racing(for the PS1) more or less. Course, Crash Team Racing is a classic beloved by all and is, often referred to as, the only Kart Racer out there to match Mario Kart. So, that's not such a bad thing after all. In this game, Crash and the whole gang are, basically, kidnapped by a villian named Velo and forced to race his lackeys to save the earth. The object of the game is to race for first place and tag buddies with as many power-ups as possible to undermine their chances of winning. Players can choose from all of the characters in Crash's world and even unlock hidden ones, as well as play though several gameplay modes. The best one, to me, being the Adventure mode. Adventure Mode has 17 different tracks in five different worlds. Races are either against a field of seven others or up against a boss character. Once these races have been completed, you must round up the relics and whatnot to finish the whole mode to achieve 100%.

The only two gripes I have with the game; which, take note, don't take away anything from the game are...one, there's no Spyro in the game(bummer)to race with or- at least- that I know of like there is in the GBA game. Second, I wish there was a more frantic sense of speed to the game. Even though there's not, what speed that is there, works.

Sonic 3D Blast: essentially a non-polygonal, 3-dimentional Sonic game.  The controls are horrible.
Sonic Spinball: if you love pinball video games you might like this one.  It's a vast scrolling pinball field with Sonic as the ball.  It never interested me.
Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine: an addictive Tetris-style strategy game for 1 or 2 players.
Flicky: very cutesy, simple 1 player game that has nothing to do with Sonic.  It's another game which must be unlocked.
Ristar: another cute game that has nothing to do with the blue hedgehog.  But unlike Flicky, Ristar has rich graphics and deeper gameplay.  Like Flicky, though, it must be unlocked.
As if the games weren't enough, Sonic Mega Collection offers a slew of bonuses including cover pics of every Sonic comic book produced, detailed illustrations of various Sonic characters, and video clips from non-Genesis Sonic games.",Chock Full of Sonic Goodness,1056758400

The skill level is rather low and is geared towards younger kids, but this dosent take away from the game. If you like the Spyro and Crash games, you'll love this one.",Wow.................

Lets look at some of the aspects of the game:
Story: You get to play through a wide variety of scenarios and story lines, some of which are based on historical events or movies.

Scenes: Well thought out and incredibly funny. The first time you die leads to a scene of such humor that you'll likely never forget.

Multiplayer: An impressive array of choices, and is even comparable to the beloved Goldeneye.

The only negative this game has is that some may consider it offensive due to some language and graphics. If you are easily offended, I'd say stay away. Other than that, go for it.",History's Greatest Game,1409097600

This is a completely different programming team that has crafted a superb Rally game!  Not only does this game single-handedly make the Test Drive label sound good for once, but it has been entirely rebuilt above the related title on Playstation (as proof of the unique origin, that original title was a ""Need for Speed"" brand).
Be it graphics, sound, features, or analog-trigger-based gameplay, the game takes advantage of the DC hardware.  In fact, of all the racers I have for the system, I'm currently most likely to pick this one and play.
It is a really tough call, but I place this one on generally equal footing with Ferrari F355 and Sega Rally 2.  It balances so that it has more cars and reasonable chance of winning versus F355 (every time I crank up the superb F355 it admittedly takes time to restore your skills just to place 3rd or 4th); and it balances against Sega Rally 2 by offering more serious Rally modes as well as an Arcade option.
While not better than those superb titles, it IS better than the overhyped Sega GT, providing a better balance than that still-good game ultimately manages.",Very impressive.,972604800

If you're expecting Sea Dogs or anything close to the old Pirates game on the PC, with Pirates - The Legend of Black Kat, you will be as disappointed as I was with this game.
This game might be good for kids learning to play video games, although it is violent.  Since I am not a kid, I grew bored of this game after an hour.  I will probably never play it again.
The game play is extremely linear.
It would be a good game for elementary school children, if it didn't have all the violence.
Basically it's not kid enough for kids and not adult enough for adults.  It's just plain bad.
If you need a crummy game fix, buy it at Amazon.  They have the lowest price anywhere for this game.",Not even Close to Sea Dogs,1034035200

The prgrammer for this game should be ashamed of themselves, they didn't do a very good job with the movement graphics. When Spyro stands still, everything around him moves smoothly. But as soon as Spyro moves, the graphics get glitchy, and sometimes the backround disappears...causing him to fall and lose a life. I really think that if Insomniac (Spyros Original developer) had made this game or something similar, it would have been better for the series. I basically only got the gamecube version because it doesn't take long to load between levels, and the graphics seem to run a little better....but most of all, Spyro is my favorite game character, so I only own it basically for sentimental reasons.",Could have been better....,1311811200

The story is great and uniqe and has
Superb voice acting filled with great and detailed cut scenes.
I got this game the time it came out and yeah its a little to late to be reviewing this game but what the hell.  Metal gear solid is about solid snake who is trying to infaltrate a terrorist base holding a new type of nuklear warheads.  METAL GEAR REX.  Snake soon finds moor enemies and Allies as this amazing progresses through.  I personaly loved every character.
My most favorite was Raven.  The game is dramatic to the max.
But not as dramatic as sons of liberty.  Meryl was an awsome character too.  Snake has feelings for her but he won't admit it and more complications occur.  The game is one of the best games I have ever experienced in my gaming time.  The BOSS battles were awsome.
The game is one of those games youll remember experiencing and the first time is the best.  The characters are all great and the voice acting is not even close to bad.  I won't spoil anymore for you but I also recomend getting TWIN SNAKES.
I got that game the day it came out and it did not dissapoint
even though I found some stuff to be better in the original than TWIN SNAKES.  For example: The final conflict between Snake and Ninja/gray fox wasn't as sad as I thought it would be in twin snakes.  The speech was more moving in the original.  But over all this game is great.  And Like I said may be the greatest adventure game ever made.",Possibly The Greatest adventure game ever made...,1079740800

Relationships had a base level, they went to their jobs, and entertainment was calling someone and inviting them over, or watching tv.  Livin' Large gave them more things tp play with, House Party gave my Sims something to do besides watch t.v., and Hot Date fills in everything you could possibly want.
Hot Date can complicate things. Instead of meeting another Sim, talking with them, complimenting them, talking some more and then hugging them to make a family friend, you now have two meters on your relationship scale.  You have the long term and daily meters, which means it takes longer to make good friends or fall in love.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing; it means you have more work before your Sims are good friends or lover.  The added abilities are nice too, they can shake hands or wave to greet someone, there's a bunch of goodbye options, and they're no longer limited to just talking, they can talk about interests, or just gossip. Also, Sims have interests, so they can find common ground with other Sims. It would be nice if you could pick each Sim's interest, but there doesn't seem to be an option for that.
This is definitely a more adult game, as there's intimate kisses and hugs, there's a cuddle option, and a blond bombshell in downtown.  The downtown is interesting, there's a lot for a Sim to do, and you can change it to look however you want.
Overall the new complexity and a seriously long load time make this my least favorite add-on.  I don't mind some of the added complexity, but this is going way overboard.  After a while it gets tiring to try and keep friendships just so, and to invite someone downtown for fun.  It takes the realism a step too far, from being a game (or toy as Maxis calls it) where you can direct things, and makes it more of a realism simulator, although the Sims don't seem to learn or get smarter as the days goes on.
The load time really bothers me, with Livin' Large and House Party, my Sims take close to 4 minutes to load, without viewing the introduction. Also, when I create a new neighborhood and check out the downtown, it takes several minutes to create it.  My computer isn't all that fast, at 1GHZ, but it's still irritating to have to wait as long as I do for it to load, especially if I'm only checking something or get called away from my computer.",Hot Date can complicate things,1017446400

But, when the game re-released onto the Nintendo 64 I was most anxious to see the job that was done on this remake of a classic. Incredibly though it was not as bad as one might have though and I actually caught myself pretty immersed into it at times. It plays and sounds extremely well making for a great gaming experience and will keep many gamers near their Nintendo 64 consoles for a great while. So pick up a classic and be happy you did.","Classic, Simply Classic",1007424000
