I always buy the same size this ones came to large
Nice looking and very light weight with a rounded square toe that left plenty of room front foot and toes.
Love these, comfortable, light weight, great fit.
The ones I received are a lot clunkier than I expected, although the quality is fine.
Ugh... way to large - is this for a man?
I LOVE Nike FLEX bottoms.
These are the best shoes I have ever use for my workouts!!!
Great arch support and comfortable.
I like the shoes.
Good support and my feet stay cool all day, also noticeably light but well-made and long lasting.
Nike really dropped the mic with this.
These might be fine for someone with a narrow foot.
Very confortable.
My wife loves these shoes.
Very comfortable shoes.
It is true to size and fits as expected.
Very nice shoe, just a bit to snug/small for my foot.
Good quality, perfect fit.  
First time I've had to buy smaller for Nike.
Normal Nike quality.
Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts.
Love the color and they fit great.
Comfortable and chic
I like the way the shoes fit around my ankle, as many shoes are uncomfortable because they come up too high in the back.  
These insoles help my heels feel much better.  
A nice lightweight shoe.
They provide great support.
They got the scent correct.
These soaps are wonderful.
Outstanding product!
First the scent is wonderful.  
I love the wide, curved brush which makes application effortless.
This bar of soap is great for putting in your bathtub.  
I have used this product for years and love it.
Everyone outside looks at it as a crazy contraption, but every owner is LOVING it!
I don't think I've ever had a real sponge like this before, and it's great for having my back scrubbed.
This is a delicious luxury that I have been enjoying for many years.
hard to find a lab coat the fits nice.  
I used this in my WaterPik with great results as well.
I have seen a dramatic reduction in the fine lines around my eyes, very happy with this cream
The cleaning itself is pretty easy.  
I hated to have to try a lot of scents to find another one I liked as well.
Highly Recommended!CFH
Cold wash, hang to dry.
Comes out of bottle like water, so very easy to waste.
everyone says "who smells so good in here!"
This smells yummy and love it during the fall!
Oh and it makes my skin silky soft.
Product has been unavailable for some time and I was happy to find it on Amazon.  
Matrix Biolage Fortifying conditioner is excellent.
The strength of the smell did die down after a couple days.  
I absolutely love Clarins Eau Ensoleillante Moisturizing Body Lotion.  
Love the fragrance, and was happy to be able to buy Moon Sparkle again!
These gloves are so super -- they fulfill a need in a better way than I anticipated.
Made dandruff worse and irritated rest of skin
Eau de Hadrien is my favorite of the Annick Goutal line & the lotion is lovely.
So with a lot of research I bought this!
Yes this bar is big ..I wish manufacturers would learn that all bath soaps should be atleast a true 8.oz
Generous amount in the packaging, can be used all over the face.
This product is a great deal.
The best I can say, is that it has a pleasant scent.
I could tell after only a few times of using it that the fine lines around my eyes weren't as noticeable.
This product was one of many in a birthday basket.
I love how soft this makes my skin and the scent is amazing.
Using this is like a mental trip to a spa.  
I LOVE LOVE LOVE this soap!!!
Will buy again
I like the way it cools my head and cleans my hair
The kids really like this flavor and the pump.
It has proven to be a great shampoo by improving the overall health of my hair.
Smells incredible...almost a musk, deep scent.
it's one luxurious treat for myself!
It feels really good on my lips.  
I love using shower gels and body washes in the shower in stead of soap for their fragrant lovely non drying consistency.
This thing is unbelievable.
This is by far my favorite Bath and Body Works collection.  
If you love Halloween and candy corn you are going to go nuts for this!!!
Good value.
This works great, wonderful product it worked good.
I have a $200 piece of junk now, I will NEVER buy another NewAir product again.
works great -have bought them before
This product is very easy to use.  
This is one of the cheaper parts so I could see getting this one (and maybe the agitator dogs and motor couplings).  
Fits well and was the proper height.
A dryer thermostat which does as it was designed, to limit the heat to the element of your dryerMr Burke
The lint eater is amazing!
Fixed my washer and fit perfect.
I love using these pens,the colors are very nice, but thepens do not always work.
This is really the strongest velcro I have used so far.  
Great for cutting metal clays.
Using it is exactly like using the larger hoops, but the thickness of the end project is only about an inch.
love the scissors - very sharp, cut various fabrics very well
It is amazing for acrylic paint.
Shipping fast, order as described.  
:) :)
There are two large creases across the labels where the backing is cut to make it easier to pull off but it interferes with printing.
I have found that I'm not that much into inks but this one is very pretty!
... i am happy with this purchase... super sharp...
Compact set for travel painting - good variety of colors.  
making crisp cutting edge on fabrics3.
My use for it, is making cuffs, button bands and collars for my other knit itmes.
The hair broke off my Morrigan statue and the glue dots held better than super glue.
Love these.
I like the added safety.
Size is good, the markers are very useful (you get 20 of them, 10 each color), the counter on the other hand, i hoped more of it, now i can see there's not much it can really do.
I test-drive my jewelry, and have been pleased with this wire.  
I was expecting the usual hint of gray you see on surgical steel wires.
The hooks are good quality and are shipped quickly, at a better price than most anything I found on Ebay, including the same hooks coming directly from China.
It's a great product.
It really bonds well and seems to stay bonded without a problem.  
This is an excellent pair of scissors, very sharpe and precise.
BEAUTIFUL & SOFT as can be, but it is a tad thinner / lower weight.
If you're unfamiliar with the techniques to use this tool go to Aunties Beads on You Tube.  
Purchased in this 5-pack, they are considerably less expensive than when bought at the quilting stores.
Great Fiskars punch as always!
The 8.45 tube is quite large.
I really like this.
Need I say more?
That said, these are beautiful.  
This set features grays and blacks that are perfect for shading and blending.
Amazon also has some great prizes.
great rulers.  
Either way, I love my new labels made with this transfer paper.
you can glue pretty much anything to it.
excellent product - bandnew.  
as descibed
so I'm happy.
It is high quality and a nice weight.  
Awesome...picture explains everything
This color is beautiful and I usually don't like gold.
Otherwise, color of Krylon is amazing.  
This string is definitely the best and a great price for how much you get!If you need string get this now!!
Excellent color variety.
Same yarn you would buy from Michaels but cheaper.
Next time I will need to review the reviews.
These are really good pipe cleaners and don't shred apart , leaving pieces behind...
Also, I'm  afraid the photos will slip out .
Repair book is as advertised, shipped quickly, no problems.
Best cold weather gloves I have ever owned!
I love this stuff great to cover up trim that is worn and just ugly.
Great fan.  
Works great just what I needed
I thought it was a mini size tach, It is the size I really wanted and it is great.
Turned old cracked leather in my 95 Riviera to smooth shiny and soft texture.  Would recommend
It would have been nice if they new this product would fit my car.  
Build quality doesnt seem so great.
Doesn't work for me.
Works great!
So far so good.
Little bit of an overkill for what I need , but once you have acar fall on you you become a little more careful .
This Wolo 310-2T low-tone horn was a good fit for my old '90 Dodge W150.
You cant find a better deal for 3 ton Jack stands.
They somewhat work, but will get pushed around when driving at highway speeds, vibrate heavily when drivnig >20mph, the extension is too short to be really useful, but bottom line, for the money, it is better than nothing.
Great for working with O-rings.
Arrived on time good price
Quick service good price
Fits the Dorman 603-001 coolant reservoir bottle.  
I thought this would be a great wax but it leaves large water dropletts on the car surface.
These lock cylinders were incredibly easy to insert into the Traverse kit.  
Always room for improvement, so I suggest making the markings just a tad easier to read.  
Best cleaner wax on the market.  
Not what I expected.
Go ahead and get one, you should like it.
Installed in 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee.
this kit is great it fixes a door that is wore out.  
Was not expecting the best quality from a sub $30 set of stands, but I guess its pretty hard to mess up welding a few bars together ...all jokes aside, solid set of stands for a solid price..definitely trust them to keep me from becoming one with the ground.
Stuck to it pretty good after I cleaned it.
Best price.
BUYER BEWARE.
This stuff is simply amazing!
I think it looks very good in my Silverado receiver hitch.
Great product, this is my second bottle.
Buy this one and you won't be disappointed.
In fact, I like most of the stuff VDO makes in the way of gauges and meters
this tool was fantastic.  
Very good all round floor jack.
My power steering was sticking.  
I have a 2000 F250 Diesel with two batteries we use as a plow truck.
Worked fine this weekend for it's first use and is currently holding up an axle.
This stuff is pretty neat, It does a great job at preventing corrosion.  
Great product!!
Easy to use, follow the directions and you won't be disappointed.
Top quality license plate covers
Great high quality Halogen replacement, but not very white, which was the reason I bought these.
It is not USA made like the puller sets I have
Great tester and very convenient to use!
Lets me watch my grand kid's without turning around,love it!
I absolutely hated the ending of this series.
The manager who manages best manages the least.
This book has sections that were very interesting, however there were other parts that were not interesting and hard to get through.
One of the most beautiful and classic books of all time.
Hemingway's descriptions are magnificent.  
I've written two reviews.  
I liked the book.
Gibran was a great author and in this book he truly shines.
He is a true master scholar.
Reviewed by Kenzie for Cocktails and Books.
Great story, although very descriptive violence can get a bit much, hence not five stars.
Dalrymple discusses at length the many great figures of Delhis past including James Forbes, Fraser, Sir David Ochterlony and James Skinner and after investigating them in books he then ventures out to find what remains of the forts and palaces they resided in.
It should make for an interesting study.
I enjoyed it, but I felt it tppk to long.
DON'T THINK TAYLOR COULD WRITE A BAD BOOK EVEN IF SHE TRIED.
Can't speak for my son
Perfect and timeless.
At this point, I realize I should have just bought the entire series in on purchase
So let's set all that aside.
It simply isn't as good a book as it could have been.
but not Beth's son.
Essential!
Still a good book though.  
Mr. Louis knows how to tell a great story!
The illustrations were beautiful...brought back many memories!
and its like finding an old friend in a new story.  
I didn't like this book when I was a child.
Gotta read them all!
you will love the bloody Scots.
Of the many books I've read about wildlife, this one sticks in my mind as one of the best, even though it's been several years since I first read it.  
Of the four Caudwell mysteries, this is the one to read last or not at all.
My wife loves Poldark --
My least favorite so far, it has thirty words when five would do.
Times have changed.  
book was fine.
This book meets that requirement beautifully.
This final book in the series was no less fantastic to read and my only disappointment is that it had to end
Reading it again now, as an adult felt like returning to old friends.
One of Mary Higgins Clark's best books.  
A must in your Hemingway library.
No really good guys to cheer for it seems
The book was in poor shape.
I believe that this is the book to have.  
That being said with the bad, there is much good in this book.
The font is so easy to read for a dyslexic such as myself and I really enjoyed reading this novel this time around.
The world of Fantasy Fiction is full of wonderful authors worth reading.
The shocks are fewer but the stories are just as good.
Great read.
If Field Marshall Viscount Slim's DEFEAT INTO VICTORY is one of the best memoirs by a general to have emerged from World War II, George MacDonald Fraser's account of his own war in Burma is one of the best memoirs to have been written by a private soldier.
Not the greatest depiction of Black people in DC.
Total B.S.
ENJOY!!!
I was happy to see "The Lords Prayer" included here, it's so appropriate for the closing song.
Thrashers,this mothaf*cker is a must have!!!PRAISE HAIL SLAYER!!!!!WAAARRFAARE!!
it's too late".
THIS IS PURE HIP HOP JAZZ
The best news is that, even at Amazon's current price, the SACD is a steal compared to the prices being asked for the out of print DVD-Audio.  
You wanted the best, you got it!
One of the greatest MC's ever.
so I got it they have wonderful deals
Due to contact rasons this video's can not be released because this was a greatest hits compliation made by A&M record not janet's current label Virgin they came to an aggrement due to the begging of A&m to feature that's the way love goes on the DVD but none the less this is a good buy.
My new purple shoes have been amazing the people next door.  
As for the DVD, it has excellent camera angles, a decent amount of special features, excellent video, and  superb sound.  
This is one of my all-time favorite music DVD's.
And Today Is The Day is one of the best bands of all time.
Of the rest...
Frank Dimino is a helluva good singer.  
Long time fans will love this.
Florence Ballard was the original lead singer.
Not a song on this video that won't bless you...miss so many of the singers who have gone to Heaven.
A Farewell to Kings has always been my favorite album (I still have it on vinyl).
What a great album.
Yeah there's still some things that sound like trying they're too hard but it seems less forced than the Lounge.  
There are some songs that I can stand like "No Time", "Big Momma Thang" (featuring then almost-famous Jay-Z) and "Drugs".
Amazing.
rock on y'all.
But like all other Outkast albums its perfectly cohesive--which is the reason all Outkast albums will forever be loved and remembered...
Great!
Jose Felicano song Feliz Navidad is the best on the cassette.
It is a great song, but this album really is an 'album's album'.
This was on vinyl on "Labour of Lust" a great album.
but I love this Deicide album.
California Love (RMX) (Disc 1)10.
I love the one Do YOu know ....
I bought this for the high resolution content and the surround sound remaster with 5.1.This is not 5.1 discrete channel, it sounds like a simple pro logic steering mix pretending to be a real surround of the album, what a pity.
Ray Thomas' two songs are overly sweet and I usually skip over them.  
This CD has 3-4 really good songs including "Come A Little Bit Closer", a thoroughly engaging pop song.
I love that song.
This is pac at his best n this review ain guna make u wanna buy the album i read reviews and they don't change my mind ur jus have to listen to it urself u won't b disapointed.
Conway's songs were always "for the ladies."
I can understand a reaction such as the preceding reviewer's.  
There's a lot more of an experimental approach, like on "Tweez" but it's refined.  
I discovered this album really late in life (being a fan of Caravan, Camel, Gentle giant, King Crimson et al in the 70's).
Collaborations left and right, each time sweet as sugar.
it plays great rock music straight through the entire album not boring one bit.
A classic album for Tupac that can't be passed up for the price even if you are new to hip hop.
This is a great album which I am looking forward to buying just as soon as it is issued as a single disc at a single disc price.
This is a great collection and if it had Bennie and Honky Cat wouldn't need anything else.
Yep, this album IS totally worth the asking price because one of the GREATEST rock/pop ballads, ever!, is on it:  
THis album is simply not good.
great quality and durable, it's been 3 years since i purchased my own and still works perfectly.
good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good
It looks like a good idea, if you don't like headsets and/or can't pony up for one of Parrot's completely integrated systems.  
Great Product for a great price
The sound quality is suburb.
I accidently spilled a drink on my display, and the screen cover was easy to clean.  
5 bucks for all three? sign me up!
It's good if only own phones.
This is a great, useful, minimalistic bag!  
Easy to use, pretty design.
I have a couple of Scala headsets (500 & 700) and he didn't like those.  
This is one of the best case I have ever had for my iPhone.  
The case was purchased for my daughter who tends to break her phones often.
I'm buying one of these for each of our cars.
Constantly slow.  
Great phone..
The hardshell is very flimsy and obviously is very easy to break.
Easy to install and easy to see.  
This is a great little charger to throw in your computer bag.
Motorola rma'd it 'to ship 15 days after receiving return'.
I had a local Walmart brand that I was using and don't get me wrong as they were only $3-4, but at the price I paid with Amazon prime and shipping this is a superior product!
love it.  
I bought the  "GTMax Black Rapid Retractable Car Charger for Verizon Samsung Fascinate"  as a replacement and have been happy thus far.  
Bought this because my IPhone wouldn't fit in a regular pouch while I had a protective case.  
This reviewer can't even spell.  
Pros:It works, had the flat head screw drivercons:screw drivers strip and the plastic things break really easily (pretty common for most repair kits the plastic prying tools usually aren't too good)
I just recieved my two otterbox cases - one black and one black/yellow.  
I wish i would get the longer one but it work well.
Great mount.
Pros:- Case is great quality and construction.  
Fun for it's time
Been almost a year and cable is still good.
I am a college student and definitely am on my electronic devices a lot, and carrying this around in my backpack has saved me many times.
The black color is not uniform throughout so the cutouts look gray but not in a stylish way.
It was never clear from BlueAnt web site what phones would/wouldn't work with Bluetooth voice commands.
Lousy article.
I have had one of these on my P7000 for over a year, and it still looks like new.  
and it was cranked over to where it looked terrible on my tab
The buttons are easy to use while driving and calls are clear.
Overall service was great but product not so good.
Love this external battery pack as it comes with the USB and micro-USB connectors so it plugs into my HTC One Smartphone and charges seamlessly.  
Small and compact without having a tangled mess to deal with.
I liked so much!
I needed a new battery because my current one was swelling up to a point sheer it caused a puncture in the battery so this battery is working great.
Don't buy this stuff.
I bought a plantronics one after I left this one in the car and the plastic piece melted in my car...
works great, everyone i talk to thinks i am on the phone and not a blue tooth.
Base is very uncomfortable to place on your lapt.
Webos is very well designed and easy to use.
Lo bueno es que tiene el sistema de autocompletar que es relativamente inteligente.
I ordered based on current wrangled pants I own.  
I was hoping they would be more like the color shown with a brown tint.
Easy to get on and off.  
Worked well in mud & water, clean easy and are quite comfortable.
This is a wonderful product for a big woman.
Love converse!
This is the most adorable costume EVER!
The pack is well made and the belt very adjustable.  
Good looks.
Very comfortable briefs.
Look and fit great.
If you like thin, then yes I'd recommend but if you need support this isn't for you.
got these because of Paul walker in fast furious, love them!!
I have tried many brands of work clothing; however, Carhartt is my favorite.
It is very easy to find a good fit and a good match and this bra will provide excellent support.
I wanted a watch for my little school girl that would slip on and off easily.
I have a muscular XL frame and this brand shirt is my favorite due to loose, comfortable fit, fron pocket, thick yet cool cotton manufacture.
I ordered these shoes because I absolutely LOVE K-Swiss shoes!!!!!  
Ordered a second Men's 9 and it is not like the pair I ordered a few months ago.  
Lots of nice colors to choose from.
If they ever stop making this bra, I will give up on bras entirely because this is the only one that I like.
The dial lights up but you can't see it very good at night.
These are comfy, fitted, make me look slim, and perfect for an apple shape.
Purchased as gift for wife.
Excellent jeans at a down to earth price!!!
I have this style from like 8 years ago and i have a size 10.  
so they don't stain as easy.
Comfortable fit, good arch support, solid toe cap protects toes from our big dog (70# weimaraner) stepping on them.
Big face!
Solid construction, great zipper.
I liked the shape & construction of the slip.  
First off, they are original, second they fit rather large so have this in mind before making your purchase but not to the point of being unwearable.
These shoes are amazing for a little toddler.
America Express gave me a refund with their purchase protection.
Once you get the right size, they're great.  
Shipping was quick an had no problems converse are alil big but they have seemed to shrink alil over time.
These babies are classic, fit great, good quality, look good.
I LOVE this watch!  
They fit, he loves them, & they came earlier than expected!
Size C/D is the perfect size for me.
She loves it and cant wait to figure out how to tell time better...
All is good in the world when you can order clothes online and they fit.
I'm absolutely in LOVE with this wallet.
My son loves these shoes.
Really good work pants, and they have size for a fat guy!!
I have been using black Swatch watches since the early 80's.
I ordered a size 4 in kids, and received a size 4 infants.  
Nice, good quality shirt.
Now that rainy season is coming along, I don't see her wearing any other pair of shoes until Summer.
The price is good and there are two pair in each pack which is a value especially if you wear them often.
Great song.
I have always like this song ever since I saw the Matrix.
Dwight is flat out one of the greatest country stars alive or dead.
Elvis is great!  
He likes it so that's all that matters to keep him calm and quiet while I'm driving.
I love that Amazon's music selection is so diverse and has what I like.
Absolutely love it!  
A little higher baritone than Dean Martin, and more like Gene Autry.
It's packed with great songs.  
I like to play the drums along with it.
It sounds a little thin to me but its the right version at least.
A great song!!
The song alone is worth the album.
Great song.
No one can tell the story better than Marvin Sapp.  
I'm fast becoming a Rascal Flatts fan.
The thought content of this song, hyping disabilities, matches the way a culture of denial has doctors who pry into the way patients with social problems have become self-inflicted.
Use this for warm up and also helping students to understand that it is their life and should be lived the way they want to ... (within reason of course) ... and make sure they are not doing something that their parents want them to do ... and are doing it because their parents want them to and not because they want to ...
One of my favorite words!  
AS A CASSETTE SINGLE BACK IN THE DAY AND TO GET THIS ON MP3 REALLY
I like that song
Ill say here and now, with no hesitation or reservation, that Eminem is easily the best rapper Ive ever heard.
Great Song ! ! !  
And "The Great Divide" is no exception.
The place was packed every weekend.
How sweet!

Oh yeah.
Sounds great
I miss you Whitney Houston!
The music is off don't sound like the original beat.
Still, a fairly nice collection.
After all I did like Purple Rain.
I love, love this song it is so up lifting!
Its good enough to hear over and over.
This is one of my favorite Five for Fighting songs.  
I like the one with a little less echo on the vocals.
None of it is really horrible (at least not completely) but none of it is really great.
I'm kvelling!
Nice lyrics, pretty girl and a nice vocal range shown.
I can enjoy great music while playing a game or reading a book
Michael Bolton always delivers top notch music and I appreciate the easy listening I get with this specific song.
Great singer and musician
great songs!  
I love this song and can relate to her pain I never thought a song like this would ever be out
Excellent music at a great price.
I have never heard a bad thing about them, Christmas Canon is one of my favorites from them.
What can one say about Whitney...she was the Voice...truly amazing  vocals.
This isn't necessarily my brand of music, but I know what's good when I hear it.
Sessions recorded March '63 in New York, both Astrud and Jobim chose to remain there, Jobim's elevator is said to be haunted, it turns on and goes to his floor with no one on it!
These are lapel speaker microphones.  
However, you definitely want to remove it when you are taking pictures, otherwise a considerable portion of lights is blocked and the quality of picture would be substantially reduced.
Aside from that, decent CPL for the money.
I WILL, HOWEVER, BE PURCHASING A COATED FILTER
Serves it purpose for a bargain price
It's Belkin so it's a very good cable for the money.  
The pads are pretty comfortable on the ears and the swivel is a good feature.
This Philips CDR is one product that needs to go back to the drawing board for a good re-engineering.
What a piece of time wasting garbage.  
The sound quality is pretty good
Used them on a ski trip
it works fine for me.
It's not sturdy at all.
Yes, there are high quality digital compatible filters at 3x's the cost
Great bass, highly enjoyable sound.  
I have tried various mice & trackballs over the years and have found this one to be the best fit for me.
It is a great asset for the beginner to advanced photographer.
The cable is of high quality and works great.
Camera does not have mounting rings for this filter - why would you list it as a useful accessory with this camera.
I also get the "Not enough power" message pop up on my computer when trying to connect one usb device.
Great for securing computer equipment.  
plug unit broke from the and now something rattles around inside the box sparks if you try to plug it in.
I think these are great headphones.
For the cost, this filter is great.
Of course, this advice is lost on young people today with their phone addiction, but for us older folks who still play discs(and demand better sound), it's great.
No longer use wired headphones as I have totally switched over to blue tooth headphones.  
I actually bought mine at either Sears or Kmart and it worked fine from day 1.  
I'm newly retired and shake some which made regular binoculars useless.
I like it so much, I'm buying another.
These are great, great headphones, at bargain price.
This is a product I had before and it is simple to hookup and it works great with no problems
The B&N Nook is a great device.
Product is fine for smaller wires and cables
My kids love to play with it!
Takes nice sharp photos.
But for this price and brand name, I guess I expected a little better.  
Great little radio for not much money.
This can be  annoying in a dark room.
I've heard no complaints so I imagine it's working like a charm.
I hate having an expensive lens exposed to scratches or impact damage - very happy to have this high-quality filter on the from of my Nikkor lens!
The price is great as well.
I'm rather new at photography even though I have had a D80 DSLR for more than 5 years but have mostly stuck to the auto mode but am now trying to learn more about it.
Who needs ceiling lights?
Without these optional eyepieces, you have no control over magnification.
This player is awful.  
The double-sidedness turns out to be a little more of a curse than a cure.
I couldn't believe the price, but the reviews here gave me the confidence to try it.
The price was much better than Walmart, so I am really im pressed.  
It was cheap enough for me to just buy it and not worry because I'm sure it's a good idea to have it.  
Chromebook.
Cute card holder.
Great Gift Card for the Movie Buff.  
Hmm not sure how to comment for gift cards, except to say that I love being able to order online, it ships securely and easy to me, and I don't have to wait in line at a store.
Great way to send a last minute birthday gift to someone through email.
My husband often forgets his cash and his bagged lunch.  
Like the salads at Wendy's and an occasional bowl of chili.  
They do work.
My neice loves ulta, so a perfect gift!
No activation charge, just regular $25 gift card.
It's very easy for me to send any thing to my grand children through Amazon.
Was a gift for a movie lover
Makes life easy to be able to order online
I Love amazon.
I get these cards so I can treat my husband to breakfast
I have ordered the Ruby Tuesday gift card many times.  
Cute Box.
The kids - all in their 20s and early 30s- loved the gift cards in their stockings.
This was a gift, to my oldest son.  
I love Wendy's, but the closets one, to me, is at Gulfgate, which is less than 3 miles.  
It is what it is.
Good idea for gift cards.  
Next year, I will include my daughter and up the amt.
It is one the younger folks like.  
Used it right away and didn't have to pay much more for two salads and a sandwich.
Will be fun to give.
We are using for a Christmas gift to relatives.
Works fine.
Never an issue with carmike.
Getting a gift card for $20 instead of $25 is awesome.  
Panda is always fresh and delicious.  
Panda Express gift cards are a great gift to get.
she loves their food.
Not a Starbucks fan but this made for a nice little extra gift for Christmas for the nieces who love it.
Nice quality case.
Better value than a card for just 1 restaurant.
There's nothing like the bloomin onion its so damn good.
Perfect gift for Christmas.
Good gift for anyone
My recipients absolutely loved their gifts.  
This is a great place to go and the food is awesome and service outstanding.
Great fast gift idea.
Boxed gift cards are a bit more difficult to use than the emailed version, but nice designs and packaging make them seem more substantial..
love gift cards
It was delivered in excellent condition.  
The perfect gift when you don't know what to buy.
Christmas gift for my parents.  Loved it!
Perfect, how can you go wrong with an Amazon gift certificate for a person who loves Amazon.
This Cupcake tin was perfect for their birthdays.
Happy with Gift Card..BUT....  There was NO* Bow on container
Good gift for the hard to please
This brand is the best tasting black cherry juice concentrate on the market.
This is the 3rd year in a row I've bought a bottle of this for each of my 3 grandchildren - they use it on snow for their cake villages which are baked in Nordicware pans.
Great gift for the Reese's lover!  
I am in love!
These candies are pretty good.
I didn't give it five stars because the chips are a little too sweet.  
Good quality.
It's about the easiest side dish to make from a package aside from maybe Ramen but that's not really a side dish.
The flavor is nice.
This coffee is the best we ever found in the USA.
My husband needed some extra calories, protein and nutrients and tried this first in a smaller version.  
this reviewers for the pine nuts I bought from this co. not mac nuts !
Ground flaxseed is rich in Omega 3, and I personally like this organic brand.
Well you know the rest
Great flavor, good value for the money.
A fine Jam, one of our favorites.
Great product in the line of three.
The size is great for taking with you as a snack but I did find them to be a little hard to open sometimes.
Magical!  
Good taste, but I had to cook the noodles 5 min longer to get them even close to an edible softness.
Love my peanut butter
There was no after taste and I found that I didn't burn food as easily as I have on occasion.
This tea is refreshing and delicious.
This stuff?  Yuck.  
A good tea that really reduces your sore throat, a life saver in the winter.
My mother makes salad often but there always seems to be shortages of dressing.. ..enter the Amazon solution which actually worked out pretty nicely!
I love black salty caviar so I thought I'd give this a chance - but salt is the only flavor/taste for this product.  
This is the finest whole grain mustard in the world.
My favorite tea by a long shot, is substantially better than every other tea bag I've tried.
EXCELLENT PRICE.
I love their teas, have for decades.  
I really enjoyed this tea!
Serious  Yumminess....
We get this product because it is the best one we've found for the small amount needed and the taste- not bitter.
I definitely like the larger size of these as compared to the standard size, and the packaging has become easier to peel apart then in the past.
It got old fast to make my family a meal that I use to love and couldn't eat.
Darjeeling tea, specifically Twinings, has always been one of my favorites, but for some reason, this tea isn't hitting the mark.
I'm not sure if it's because I haven't really had a chance to eat crackers since I stopped eating GMOs or that these crackers are really THAT delicious, but I love them.
This was the most disgusting cinnamon tea I have personally ever had!
The flavors do come out as weak but good.
I also add in dried onion flakes and a bit of onion powder when adding all of the ingredients (use more flakes than powder).
I added it to my burgers, they came out great, but one bottle is already gone and the 2nd bottle is half empty and I only got them 2 weeks ago.  
got theses for my hubby when he watches sports, there great will buy them for a long time
No damages.
I am not a proper English lady who serves tea at garden parties.  
I love the almost-rubbery
Item was just as expected at a great price.
A long time ago this soup was good.  
Stash is always an excellent choice!
These Knorr side dishes are proving to be tasty, fast and easy to make.  
It's heavy and sharp enough that it almost makes a set of kitchen knives obsolete, and the build quality is very good (no dubious rattling or cheap fastening.)
I love this peeler.
Because of it's non stick coating cleaning it is also very easy, I like to clean most of my kitchen tools by hand
So far I haven't needed to use it, but glad to have it on hand.
At this price I expected a little more.
The filter is a nice addition
love these little magnets .
I do a lot of canning and this is an indispensable item for my busy kitchen.
Despite trying several different brands of popcorn, this particular brand didn't make really good tasting popcorn.
Bagel feature isnice, but I certainly overpaid for it.  
This is the bomb!
I have very small hands and so something like this is sometimes hard to use.  
Best kitchen addition this year!
I was pleased  the cake didn't stick and was easy to remove.
this is good, packaged well and came as expected.
I can not believe how beautiful this pitcher is - it is a work of art.  
Nice, heavy glass.
Easy to use and not scary to use since it has a fool proof safety release.
This makes chopping apples SOOOO much easier!
Very well made.
Smaller than I expected, especially with all the advertising about being "professional, bar" model.  
Don't use a sifter often, but love that this one has a cover and is not too large.  
I hope I was not overpaying for something that sounded wonderful.
If shopping online, suggest that you look closely at pictures for a flat cooking surface.
I especially love it at work so there's not so much mess.  
Words are very limited and pieces are small.
I enjoy using this cute little chicken timer for all kinds of things.
It's stayed very stiff and it's the right length for setting across a standard double sink so you can pour your food into it without it falling over.
It gives me a nice fine mist of oil, perfect for oiling my waffle iron, pans, etc.
OXO always has the best products--definitely the best value.
This is easy to use, and so effective.
Great for making finely chopping onions, as needed in many Indian curries and Indian-style omlettes where onion pieces are embedded.
It fit great and worked equally well.  
And even if you don't have dexterity problems the handle makes it very easy to peel a lot of potatoes and carrots.
It was easy to install.
This is absolutly the most fantastic item.
I really like it.  
I love this knife.
Makes great espresso.
I bought the 3 cup but I think by tomorrow I'll beordering the 9 cup.  
A great accessory for the toaster oven, especially if you use it every day like I do.
These magnets are great fun for everyone when they visit.  
I bought this to cook a large Turkey in, if need be, better to have more room than not, got a large, concise, well written booklet with the Cooker, had it several weeks and have cooked a Boston Butt and a Corned Beef brisket, turned out very tender and tasty, this cooker also watches your dog, tie him/her to this thing and they're going nowhere, this thing weighs a ton!!!
Works very well, and it cleans easily.
I got these to use over a hot outside grill.
Makes excellent popcorn very easily.  
Incredibly sharp when new - so be careful!!!!
This only lasted 8 months.
Looks exactly like the Kenmore 32002.- NEGATIVE:
The grill's small size makes it easy to pack on camping trips (because I hate dirty propane grills) or on vacation.  
Great quality PG for making your own e juice
We've used Colgate toothbrushes over the years.  
These are a fairly good deal and I like that they come in 100 count with lids.  
nice little set of beakers,fairly thick glass and decent markings
These worked perfectly
Nice and loud.
Perfect!
Nice strong chain, 10ft will allow me to get use for 3 different projects, at the moment it's on my go kart, transfers power nicely.
Good all around choice.
These are also good for measuring out oils scent diffusers.
It's easy to read and very accurate.
...the adjusted length as measured from the support rod is not adequate for me.  
HERE IS THE TRICKY PART....
It is a good brush though.
To be useful, the mirror would have tone twice the size.
Reviewers who state this magnet doesn't stick to their frig or whatever are probably unaware that MAGNETS DON'T WORK ON STAINLESS STEEL.  
Made in China.
These are the best in Latex gloves that I've found after extensive research.
Good stuff.  
Perfect for dying leather.
Easy to install, easy to code up, and reliable.  
A must have for any electrician or handyman or do it yourselfer
A great tape that saved my camping trip experience.2.)
Well made and durable, these allowed me to repair some cabinets I had where the original plastic wheels had broken off.
I was pleased at how easy these tests were to run and feel confident (based on other tests) that the results are accurate.
Remember you are paying convenience in this type of packaging.
Worked fine for that application.
Doesn't burn, even with a soldering iron to it, but the sticky is just horrible all the way to the end of the roll.  
Amazing lube, much better than WD-40 and zero overspray.
Great for 2L yeast starters.
Ive been an electrician on/off for about 45-years and there is definitely a difference in electrical tapes.
The purpose of this coupling is to connect a second length of hose to standard hose that came with my Shop Vac.
It will cradle the edge of furniture, if you balance it, or cradel a foot.
These apparently prime the plastic to aid in a reliable attachment.
I love these guys!
Takes BO accurately just like at the doctor's office.
Glass bottles are nice but these things have one glaring issue.
Jason makes good products.  
They greatly improved the storage of my spare rechargeable AA and AAA batteries.  
It is not water soluble so you cannot wipe the excess with a wet rag (I had to use lacquer thinner).
Quality is good, material is conformable, highly recommended.
Just what I needed, and Great to Keep Around.
Its not going to give you a perfect aesthetic repair, but it functions very well.
Perfect for those no mounting hole style applications.
Wire ends accommodate round pins on small compressor.  
Hard to get excited about lab plastic/glassware.
Cheapest staples on Amazon.
Bravo!UNLIKE some thicker plastic tape which will not conform to the shape of the package, THIS tape DOES - very willingly --
Always good to have these along with other sizes in the shop when you need some for different projects.
This one's kerf is just the right size too.
I recommend the entire series.
The second is that a fair number of the words it does accept are so obscure that I doubt 1 in 1,000 Americans would even recognize them as words.
I enjoyed reading this once I got into it.  
This is a book that's definitely not for the faint of heart.
For a novella, the story and characters are remarkably well-developed.
ON MY COMPUTER - NO BOOK TO CARRY AROUND -  I RECOMMEND THIS CLASSIC AUTHOR TO YOUNG AND
Age Before Beauty is another wonderful story from Virginia Smith.
Thanx KINDLE!
This book  was interesting from page one  the writer kept the people moving along at a steady pace and  the book had a nice flow I ve read a lot of Marie Force and this one is as good as all I  read
First I want to say, the book wasn't bad for the price.  
I made some flash cards for him, but I soon realized that I've forgotten most of the language I once knew.
This story was well written and HOT!!!
this really was a bad story I do like age play books but this one was awful.  
The Collected Works of Wiliam MacLeod Raine was a very good e-book and found it very interesting and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys western stories.
I loved the whole book, my only complaint is I didn't get another story right away.
Halliday is great with the first book of this set (Hollywood scandals)with the character building and depth
I intend to read the next book.
I loved this book..first time reader of this author will definitely be reading her other books..Great characters with a good ending.
Well...I liked it and I did not like it.
But not just ended it but ended it as a HAPPILY EVERY AFTER even though there was so many questions left unanswered.  
The Ultimate Choice has a generally good plot with an interesting premise for a future society.  
Readers will love April.
About a third of the way through the book, the authors start recycling tips so you don't even get the variety of tips that the length would suggest.
Makes you grit your teeth at the unfairness of it all.
It was a waste of time, I'm glad there was no waste of money.
I really wanted to like this book, but it was way to silly and stupid for me.
Fun, enjoyable book.
It's easy to read and understand.
That ain't easy, so kudos on that.
An all around great novel.
Most kids would also enjoy this game  much, much better than shooting games, etc., its quick and has some educational value.
Great story about two people misunderstanding each other.
I did enjoy reading this, and as soon as I finished I bought and read the whole series.
My full The Nightmare Within review can be found at AudiobookReviewer dot comWhat a story!
I'm so glad I did.
I was given a copy of book for a honest review..
but overall it was a good read.
Wish brevity could've be abandoned in favor of a little more character development m
There's a good chance you'll want to read more after finishing this one!
Love this version of the bible, have read it everyday since purchase,  So I am totally happy with the navigation and the direct verse jump.
Once I realized that this is part one of a series (a very long series of books) I chose not to continue reading.
A bit hard for a novice to follow...but still a strong read.
I know this book is a few years old, but examples of $85,000 - $150,000 aren't super common either.  
The premise was good, basic characterization well thought of.
I enjoyed this story,  there is something about the main character Ross really pulls you in, I recommend this story.
Very cute, very charming, very uplifting, very nice...
Another enjoyable gunslinger novel I've happened upon is the `The Dark Tower' - by Stephen King.
I was so dissapointed for what could have been a good read for me turned out to be a waste of time.  
If you want to know, this book will inform you.
*****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.
This is worth the purchase."
the more natural the better.  
The beads that comprise the scrub are large.  
Great value and multipurpose iron.  
This flat iron is replacing my 10 year old flat iron that I love.
ThickThickCreamyThickThis is what this face cream feels like on my dry dry skin, I put this on at night after cleansing my face, and it makes me feel like I am really taking care of my skin with the most amazing product.
I love this cleanser.
It dispenses from a tube and gives a nice satiney finish.
Love it!
The 8 oz bottle is easy to handle and use.  
I feel like it's a better experience when the stuff is really caked on.
Vichy's Thermale Foaming Cleanser feels like a cream cleanser in that it's gentle on my skin and doesn't dry it out.  
I liked this sunscreen and it does a good job.  
Overall a great product.
Thank goodness!  
I love the gel cleanser and "age defy" serum from the same line, so I had high hopes for this.
Smell is weird.
Smells clean and fresh.  
On the other end of the spectrum is greasy.  
The first glove was easy to put on but I had trouble with the second glove getting the fiber-ish layer to open up.  
The Micellar Water Cleanser is a great, if not slightly pricey, cleanser that has done everything it claims to do while remaining gentle on the skin.
Love Love Love
The scent is subtle and enjoyable.
I love all cosmetic products that are cruelty-free - not tested on animals(Vegans rejoice)  and Oribe Glaze for Beautiful Color fits the bill.
The good point is that the glass is tinted , as vitamin C products are sun sensitive.
I highly recommend this tinted moisturer for cooler seasons and/or for people with really oily skin.
I like this cream.
I've been impressed every day with this shampoo.
I don't like it straight out of the bottle, but I do like it.  
Really am impressed.
You'll love it.
Excellent quality and kind with my skin.
According to my wife, "I like how soft and smooth my hair feels after I use it.  
I have a super sensitive nose and often sneeze around cologne, but this one does not seem to cause that reaction!
The good thing about this is that I won't lose the cap or forget to put it back on.  
The concealer is easy to apply and takes just a couple seconds to blend in for excellent blemish hiding.
At a $21 price point, I don't love it enough to purchase more, but we will continue using this till it's gone.
I rotate this mask, the Whiteneing Mask, and the Super Collagen Mask.
It is not sticky like most of the bar deodorants out there.  
I didn't care for this product, but in good news, it does help block sun.
Was so pleased that I purchased another shade in the same family, in order to do some subtle contouring and create the color that was absolutely perfect for my skin tone.
The stage of acne does not matter... like i did not applied anything.
It glides on like lipstick.  
This is great stuff, I agree, but is it pushing 300 bucks great?
iused s directed aand found it easy and pleasant to apply.
I spent a few thousand dollars on laser and only $200 on Obagi and love the results.  
As this one goes, it's terrible.
While I like the product the pump bottle is very poor quality.
I like this product.
but I am telling you this super fine powder is truly correcting and has improved my skin.
I love this magazine and pick up lots of tips from every issue for maintaining our 8 acre piece of property.  
This is definitely not Martha Stuart style.  
Food should involve a sense of discovery.
yummy and simple recipes

It's just disappointing where this magazine has gone.
The physical magazine is printed on decent enough stock to last the viewing week.
Great magazine for horse tips such as blankets, tack, riding both English & Western.
Combining incisive reporting with humor and a bit of serendipity, The Economist is a must-read in today's global world.
Veranda features classic homes that are actually liveable.  
It can be easily carried along in a purse or bag for traveling, and of course it makes a perfect addition to your bathroom library.
I have had it before, and there are a lot useful articles and tips.  
I wear contact lenses so I don't have "bad eyes".
Great magazine really good recipes
Great write-ups on local vacation destinations.  
Great Ideas - Dazzling chandeliers add drama to a roomand my personal favorite article in Design Solutions called "A Good Buy", featuring some terrific smaller space ideas for living and dining spaces.
Vanity Fair is one of my favorite magazines.
Always insightful articles that are written by knowledgeable people.
works good, buy lots
Rated it low because it is a waste of money.
This is my favorite 'family' magazine of all times.  
Mental Floss is a great magazine that you can sit down with and read in one sitting.  
It's also more affordable than some of the high-fashion magazines.
If you are new to working out, then this magazine is probably great for you.
This mag needs a new editor.
WW has so many great herb and natural remedies.
Yes, it's that bad.
If you get it on special it is worth the money, but i'm not sure about paying full price.
Stuff like washing machines, new cars, computer monitors, even sunscreen.  
Full-length investigative articles, great interviews, current games and gadgets.
was boring, nothing much to the magazine, very few pages and no news about celebrities that I hadn't heard before.
Do you love collecting quality photos of your favorite stars?
Their articles on nutrition are good, and once again realistic.  
A little more celeb info that necessary but a good and more fun source of information regarding health and beauty tips
It's like getting a gift.  
best mag ive seen in years
Little article content.
This magazine over-all is not bad.
I enjoy this magazine very much  And especially this one on COLOR.  
After awhile, the magazines seem to blur together and have the same tips/advice on nutrition, workout plans and beauty products.
Very tech like.
Informative and often brilliant.
no real articles and even the pics are not of interest to me.. .
It is the mag I look to to make me feel good!
But the articles generally were disappointing, so I decided to just read it at the bookstore whenever a decent article appeared.
This magazine has excellent advice for everything from travel concerns to fitness and beauty advice.
It's OK
This is a great magazine for anybody who enjyoys watching birds from the casual weekend birder to the die hard watcher who wants to do a big  year.
I LOVE this magazine.
yeah, who cares?  
I got it based on a Tulsa World film critics recent article.
I wanted to like this movie because it stars a couple of my favorite actors in Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt.  
The actor did a great job to make me hate his acting and this film...
Quality of DVD very good.
I really loved this story!
For anyone with a handicap to who loves a one should watch this true story about a man who overcame his limitations and contributed to society.  
The phalanx of cannibals and vampire-like troops eating people alive and animatronic creatures like Licker, Zombie Dogs doesn't exactly fascinate either.
Julia Roberts ,in a star making performance ,plays Vivian Ward an LA hooker who meets millionaire wheeler-dealer Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) and he falls in love with the lady,and gives her an extreme style makeover.
Great product and perfect transaction.
Daniel Day Lewis and Juliet Binoche deliver stunning performances.
Good music, scenery, and comic relief were not featured in this film.
A classic.  
Crazy story, but fun to watch.
A spectacular satire and a showcase for Bale's talents; American Psycho isn't quite a classic, but it's pretty close regardless.
Got it just before I needed it.  
It's a great "what if" movie.
What I did appreciate was the telling of a story not often told.
Bought for grandson, He stated he like movie.
it was a life changing transaction that will forever change me and shall have deep meaning for my connection with Amazon and everyone affiliated with such a grand company
I LIKED Ford's voice-over narraration.
I like this movie for the love story between Bruce Lee (Jason Scott Lee) and Linda Lee (Lauren Holly)!  
This is by far the best this film has ever looked.
I also love the screaming when Wild Bill Kelso's (John Belushi) planes crashes down on Hollywood Boulevard.  
Like Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums, their follow-up films, Bottle Rocket is a wonderful mix of deranged humour and quiet sadness.  
Hard Target is one of the best action films ever.  
Great movie, how one mans past hunt's him through his son and he never gives up to ensure his son's future from being trapped in the gang life
What  a great vintage movie...
It really adds to our Sesame Street collection.
This is one of the funniest movies ever made!  
That's how good Daniel Day-Lewis is in this film.  
It also has some of my favorite actors in it.
VERY WELL ACTED IT'S LIKE LOOKING INTO THE WINDOW OF LIFE..WATCHING IT NEARLY FALL
Definitely one of his favorite lines now is "Get off my plane!"
I'm a Boris Karloff fan.
The story is easy to follow.
Unforgettable film!
This is an excellent movie that does a brilliant job and saying what it is trying to say.  
The mark of a great film is when it speaks to later generations.
There's not a behind the scenes look, but I guess it's still cool.
This movie is definitely worth watching even if you saw it before.
I'm very glad she has written it.
Its a okay movie.
The songs are great and the movie is enjoyable enough  for me and my mom to watch over and over again.
loves a working man.
I think that it is a great movie, despite (or maybe because) it having no big names.
Great movie
Unlike the special edition of the MAD MAX DVD, this one is austere at best: a "passable" dolby 5.1 mix and subtitles.
Can't believe Pretty Woman is over 15 years old now!
It's a feel good movie and one that is sure to please most everyone who watches it.
Mel Brooks and Leslie Nielsen are great acting together in this madcap movie.
They work just fine, nice solid feel, screws included, and white or black tips.
I put these in a Sawtooth tele.  
Very bright and crisp and they feel like they have some meat to em'.  
I haven't used jet, looks strong, but maybe I would use it only to cut the strings when needed
Had a terrible time figuring out how to put this contraption on and haven't used it since purchasing.  
The best for mounting your favorite axes!
I only replaced the one broken one and it matches the tone wonderfully, but if any other strings break I'm glad to have a dependable backup!
Works great.
By far my favorite pics!  
A deal!
Great stand.
If you don't like them, just stop reading and go buy your own favorite.
bought these as a gift for my grandson and he loved themb
I use them sparingly.
The Ernie Ball 2004 light strings provide little packaging waste, a good value for the strings, and most importantly, a sweet sound when strung and tuned to the guitar.  
For the price, this stand is easily the best value in trumpet stands.
This is a great bass for the price.
Will be buying from D'Addario & Co. Inc. again in the future.
so i thought it may be a good match for my lutheir built flamenco guitar.
Oddly enough, the last set I stuck on my wife's Alvarez was back in the late 90's.
Easy to tune, great sound, affordable.
Plus it's fun to gross the girls out with this when they see the name and the green goo.
Great strings.
It is ideal for doing interviews in the field and studio.  
My guitar is 41 inches long.
I've tried everything over the years, and always end up coming back to these.
My other guitar has a Fishman piezo system, and people always tell me that it sounds good.  
Love the response I get from these.
GOOD TOOL TO HAVE
How great is that!!!
Great tubes .. however, it was in a big box with nothing  to protect the tube.
What's there to say, they are drumsticks
This is the best EQ for guitar.
It's a great pedal only problems were that the first one I got never worked (but the second one did) and it's a little annoying having to press down the pedal fully in order to turn it on and off because that means that you don't know whether or not it is on just by looking at it.
Oh the sound this makes!!
My cat also loves them.
but so far so good, nice strings for the price.
Better dynamic vocal mic for extreme metal styles, like hardcore, death metal, black metal, metalcore, deathcore, etc.
Good but needs more polishing cloths
Effects aren't too bad.  
Most students need a mouthpiece not a different reed.
I play every day for a couple hours.
BY FAR the best mic I've found at this price point
This filter works great and is priced right for those musicians on a snack ramen diet.  
I got this because I really enjoy the sound of a mandolin and the price is amazingly cheap.
Recommend to all wanting good quality and a great price.
They are quieter while changing positions.
Can't find a better deal anywhere else.
it is used to hang my chalk bag on now, other than that it has not been used, a nylon with pantie hose works just fine
The BEST thing about it is, IT WORKS.  
The image quality from my inkjet is pretty good...
It is thick and durable and looks nice too.
Pros:- outdoor weather resistant- not permanent, no drilling needed- easy to use- affordable, less than four dollar for 60" tapeCons:- not ideal for desert weather, hot and dry- it fell off after two months, don't use for fragile stuff-
Great for people who have a lot of reference material that they are constantly needing to look at.
Performed as promised
Nice quality at a cheap price.
The quality was good and it functions well.  
Very pleased
great paper with bold lines..
If you have a label maker you need these.
The base is a thin but sturdy plastic.  
First, it is an exceptionally ugly object.
It is the only Avery product that I have had a problem with.
By experimentation, I learned that a soft reset followed by a warm reset got it going again.
Great pens.  
Best use & size in my hammer tacker for applying tar paper to the roof
For the office - This can't be too exciting.
Overall I am happy with my device.
I don't know if this tape is terrible now or if I got a bad batch
ABC, a book I wrote and illustrated.
I love that it is magnetic.
If you need to keep the shredded material in the bag when you toss it, then buy some cheap bags to transfer the shredded material into.
This has been one of the best purchases I have made.
Cute.
Used it to mount door seals on the outside if my door.  
Perfect size for me.
A book of this sort would be better served by having at least two pages of data for each book.
And the price is right.
Quality is bad.  
I like to write/draw in it with a set of Staedtler technical pens which come in a hard case, and I can keep my pad and pens together in my bag by slipping the pen case into the pad's elastic band.
Quality weight packing tape.
Worked well seems a little flimsy.
So much fun!
A good purchase!
We attached to the playroom wall with the temporary poster stickups and it's fantastic.
It holds business cards.  
Great prices on these.
My boss always comments on my fantastic office supplies.
My family and I are enjoying both the printer and the paper.
Great for artists, excellent quality paper.
The paper is a nice soft white -- easy on the eyes -- and the book lays flat when open.
Stick-on rectangles that have the letters and numbers preprinted make for a better option.
Rollerballs are my go-to pens now.  
It is a thicker paper, so it feels like a lightweight card stock.
Easy to punch.
Just cute notepad for inexpensive.
Other than getting a little dirty, the old one still feels great!  
Makes a clean straight cut.
See "comments" on this review where someone much shrewder than I got it right -- still it SOUNDS good *.* )
You get a large variety of colors and smells.
Lid fits fine.....just a little smaller than anticipated, but, will still work fine for fireplace ashes..lighter metal than some, but still more than adequate for the price
I found the chip at the front of the trap no cheese.
The Fiskars Composite Soil Scoop works great.
The USED to work great.
Got rid of the snails eating my young plants!
So yeah, it's easy to assemble, adjust, and use.
Good product, low price, shipped quickly.
Yet another fantastic chain that fits, cuts and sharpens like the best.  
I feel this is a great value and it delivered as promised.
It's a 15 ft hose and works.
Hates to be you, or any animal that get caught up in this.
To get rid of the decollate snails I've used this product before and have always been happy with the results.
I have so many hummers, these feeders make it simple for me to fill up and refill and please the very hungry hummingbirds I have.
So far happy.  
I have 15 hummingbirds fighting over this particular one.  
does a great job of attracting mosquitos until it is used up.  
great skewers for appetizers.
I use water from my water fountains to mist.  
I would like a couple more for the dogs in the neighborhood and the walkers that let the dogs go on the grass without clean up.
Great product arrived as described and fast shipping and excellent customer service !!!!
That being said, I assembled the product (which was very easy to do) before I realized that I ordered the wrong size.
I'm glad there is no handle.  
Great for yard-cleanups of fallen branches and trimming.
Nicely made but lid does not fit tightly - we use it to store bird food - would not use this outdoors due to loose fitting lid and our racoon & squirrel friends could easily get into it.
Hoping those cats will retrain themselves to go to the bathroom in their own yard as our front lawn is constantly soaked.  
It made some noise and it wasn't the gentle bubbling sort of thing as I expected.  
As to the permethrin inside, it's permethrin and it works great if properly applied and used.  
Fittings are brass and, as expected in a hose that claims to be "professional grade" , sturdy and fit well both ends.
This is a very strong and durable pump as everyone knows Danner makes one of the best mag drive pumps out there and you can buy all the replacement parts easily.
The heater feels well made and puts out a good bit of heat.
Buy it for the  great heater it is.
Mine lasted a couple of days.
But its sturdy, flexible and I've used the bulbs for easily 16 hours a day for 3 months and its still going strong.
I live in wooded area and the varmints are always in my garage.
Don't waste your money.
It's very easy to use -- much better than a little spade.
This is a pretty basic design.  
Great easy to use product for beginner hydroponics gardner.  
now  this is a sprinkler there is no substitute for a rain bird....
Great squirrel feed -- the squirrels love it and frequent our feeder.
these are great sponges.
My wife was appalled at the violence.
Over the years, I've found that the best buy is black oil sunflower seeds, which attract a wide variety of birds and is available in 20-lb bags for about $16 (or about 80 cents per pound).  
Fast shipping,item as described,happy with my purchase...Thank You
Edging - works much better than I anticipated.
The lights install easily, work well, and look great.
We've been on a search for the best rubs and this is not it.  
OMG great item I am hooked my body has to have it there is something very powerful about live foods I just discovered sprouting but it is a staple in my lifestyle that I value greatly.
Perfect OEM fit on my Craftsman 6.75 high when trimmer.
These are much better than the rotisserie chickens available in the super markets.  
Still wet food is always better than dry in my opinion so don't go back that way.
I tried a sofa cover, but after my Japanese Chin with his "catlike agility" scratched the top of my leather sofa, it was time for something else.
However, my dog really seems to like them.
I can't speak for the taste, but my dog really likes them.
Too much of a chewer.  
Thank you for a solid product that has kept our pets safe.
The fact that they are wheat free is a big plus as both me and the dog are off the stuff these days.
Update 10/5/10: Believe it or not, my dog still loves this bone!  
This is the best cat toy.
I thought my cats had tried this and liked it, but when I bought a case they wouldn't eat it.
Love being able to just look at my aquariums and check the ammonia levels.  
Good quality, and expect it to last as long as my dog doesn't hide them in the yard.  
Because chihuahuas in sunglasses are so darn cute!!!
My dog is obsessed with the mini version of the chuck it balls.
Have a small dog and these were too hard for her.
I ordered anyway because both of those colors were fine with me.  
my Burmese cats are now well behaved!
I've been using this for years and it's great.
This product is so valuable in my quest to help my older dog (large boy, 112 lbs, was 120 lbs) feel healthier,his coat is coming in shiny in his twilight years, he is sleeping better, I have also added to this product, an egg,ground beef, and brown rice dog food(homemade) daily,Great Product!!!
My kittens LOVE this stuff!  
Its making my nitrate levels rise and seems to be working great!
Other than that, it works fine.
This bulb does make heat, but it is not purely infrared; it also puts out a flood of red visible light.  
My lab loves running the longer distances to retrieve his ball.
My family's two elderly cats loved this wet cat food.
my little doxie loves these.  
I've been giving my older Dog grain free treats and food, this has whole wheat flour.  
This is the best way to play with my dog.  
Dexter the pug just loves this hedgehog.
So I used to get this at a different store for $20 more than Amazon and was SUPER happy when I saw that Amazon sold it for cheaper and on top of that they have the three month delivery option which saves me a lot of time!
my cat did not like it at all.
New favorite toy.
My puppy is a yellow lab and he loooves his "dino" toy.
Should I ever get a bigger or smaller yard, I will buy another Chuckit! to use for that yard.
The dogs love them and they are not plastic or nylon so they won't hurt the dogs tummy.
Great item..
Our 3 cats will all eat this flavor of Wellness (a miracle in itself!)
In the food dispensing toys, I end up with meat powder all over the house and I need to clean the floors.  
I have a goldendoodle / doodle that has shown to have a fickle stomach.  
Better than described.
Kind of corn flake size pieces.  
A little to early to tellEasy to use and place in tankJust make sure you get a fresh one that hasn't expired yet.
Dog loved it, and it lasted longer than most of the dog-toy-plushies.  
Happy With!
Its not a cheap brand, I just think there are better quality brands out there.
Crumbs scatter across the floor.
The highest value treat EVER for my very treat motivated dog (my less treat motivated dog loves them too).
This Dental Chew has been great for my pug - he is a fairly aggressive chewer and this Chew has held up roughly 3 - 4 months.  
To my surprise, this toy has survived a ton of damage and my dog absolutely loves it!  
I had to use it twice, with the 24 hour wait in between, but now my aquarium is clear again!
I love the smaller size bottles of coke.
The pieces have the perfect size from my point of view.
No problems
Arrives in great shape.
Too many peanuts,like funky nuts like almonds,pecans,price good
Usually I end up using it for mashed potatoes, but you can make a pretty good quick potato soup as well.
My cats and dogs :/ like this food!
Great seller!
Still I don't know if I'm crazy over eucalyptus smell.
This was a poor purchase for me.
These glass wipes at first glance seemed like a good option for quickly cleaning bathroom mirrors, windows, and glass tabletops.
Perfect for snacks or to throw in lunches.
Tide has been a favorite detergent of mine for a long time, and this version has Downy fabric softener already added, to cut down on laundry room clutter or make it good for traveling.
Of all the Pringles, those are my favorites.
Seriously, you won't find better paper towels!
Like sun tan lotion.
Organic means more expensive, but I really liked these snack bars.
Smells nice going in, but there's no smell when the clothes come out of the wash.  
love this grape flavor.
GREAT BAGS
I love this product,  it leaves your hair looking fuller and shiny and alive.
I also marinade them with a can  of green beans, a small can of button mushrooms, chopped onion and a. Little red bell peppers for  light salad...I use fat free Italian dressing  on them
Tuna was great.
Gee, pasta is pretty much pasta but this is on brand that if you like the first box you buy, you will like every subsequent box.
The same delicious jelly just 10x easier to get out.
A good value for a junk food.
Kitchen staple
I just don't like to pay a ton for such a standard flavor combination.
Delicious but the pepper builds up in your mouth.
Gatorade will certainly replace your electrodes after a hard work or a bad bout with vomit and diarrhea...you will fill better quicker to get those vital electrolytes  replaced with this delicious lemon lime drink..my family especially likes the citricy  lemon lime refreshing flavor for more energy quicker...
Very good to store everything in.
I drink a lot of fluids.  
Yuck!
Good soap.
delicious food,I like it very much!
The cake is very easy to make and affordable.
This stuff smells great!
Nice shells, nothing special though.
One of the best teas around.  
Tastes like the old Yuban to me!
Great product, great buy
mac and cheese or chicken bakes. adds just a hint of flavor over the bland unflavored bread crumb offerings.
They are very flavorful and I like that they are organic.
I like this water it taste good
I love the All brand!
The juice is nice,the bruit forgettable.
ALWAYS WORKS
, the compete does a better job of drying than the regular.
Delicious and not overly sweet!
I don't really have any complaints about these paper towels.
Too bad.....
I love all of corels programs
I have been using Intuit's Turbo Tax Deluxe to do my taxes for many years.
This isn't a review, but commentary.  
Would not recommend this old version.
I am an amateur photographer and this software has served me well.  
This was the second time that I've had a anti virus program screw up my computer when I tried to install it.
We now know that you don't care that some of your customers won't be able to use the same TurboTax product as last year.  
Reports have the other Virus programs a being better.  
Full-featured image and photo editing software for the budget-minded.
That portion of the program is excellent.  
I love this software.
If you need to tinker - get a lawyer.
Arbitrators almost always find in favor of the company so why even bother going there.  
Pretty unexciting.
I would like to say that I am not a business owner by a stay at home Mom that has always been in charge of our finances.
I upgraded to Windows 8 because my Windows 7, which I generally liked, was repeatedly breaking down, possibly because of innumerable updates over the years.
This is a pretty good piece of software if you're a small company, looking to save some money on legal documents.  
Font Manager is a nicety but not it's not going to be a staple in your everyday use.
It's Norton.  
I added this to my new Macbook Pro and am very happy with how easy and simple this is to use.
the software has a lot of cool features, and if you are into video editing no doubt you will love this program.
It does provide adequate security.
My favorite for "set and forget" is BitDefender, it had saved me several times but otherwise it just leaves me alone and doesn't bog down my system resources.
So far this matrix switch has been working great for us in a conference room environment.  
ON VISTA, DOES NIS 2008 WORK BETTER THAN NIS 2007?
That is not a condemnation of the application, it is an admission the capabilities here are vastly beyond my business needs so the underlying motivation to exploit it to the fullest is just not there.
The software was easy to use and most of the terms were explained well and had more detailed references available.  
This product is a good product for a person that casually surfs the net and checks their own email but it has a difficult time with some websites that are clearly non invasive.  
This is actually pretty good for the price, but is definitely not the best photo and video editing on the market.
This is good software that works well, but would like to see the install process greatly improved.
I liked all the options in this software.
A full system scan takes FOREVER.
The backup is very easy to setup.
Yes, I've used it, but no I can't seem to do anything cool with it beyond cropping and resizing as needed.
All is fine now!
Did my homework on these network-through-your-household-wiring things, and was skeptical.  
My 16 year old daughter is using this program for art this year and loves it also.
I'll be looking for a replacement.
This is a great program at a descent price,  Has a lot of great features, many of which I personally will never use.
If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.
The Kindle for PC download may sound like a easy fix for everyone else, but I finally found a computer guy who could make it work for me.  
Very reliable and stable.
This is very, VERY disappointing.  
I've been using Quicken for over 15 years, and I am always apprehensive when it comes time to update to a newer version.  
The headset is very comfortable but it is a pain to have to wear one.  
One hour hold time to speak with tech support, unacceptable, and the software seems buggy
The process of learning is geared toward an immersive process where you start speaking pretty much right at the start (kind of like being tossed into the pool and told to swim).
That's the good news.
I really enjoy this software for playing files.
Material is ok.
It was super easy for 4 man tent.
The target is of standard quality and well worth the cost.
I've heard that it's a great deterrent for intruders.
I got works fine for my uses
Too much of a hassle to return due to sizing issues.
This disc flies better than most.
It even made my truck run better.
It did its job well, handle was fantastic and despite the blunt end not intended for stakes and nails, it still worked.  
Well built ball.  
Just a good little hard box with nice foam to keep delicate stuff safe.
This is absolutely a great knife / tool.
Love these bands.
Works as expected.
I like P90X but have to modify a few of the exercises.
My wife and I tried this meal and it was delicious.  
I use it to spray my new sneakers so I wasn't too mad, it made them look a little vintage.
And it is super comfortable!
Really nice EDC.
Worked on a few really mean aggressive dogs out in the country.
Awesome dart board!  
I do a ton of hot yoga and this mat has held up wonderfully.
Item as described!
This rack is good for bikes with disc brakes.
I was hesitant to buy these because they seemed too good to be true based on cost, quantity, and description.
try the foot warmers too: best purchase ever!
Make sure measure the right size for your bike frame.
We are scheduled for three weeks on Maui this year, and the bands will be added to our suitcase to give us an exercise option right in the condo, before we go out to the pool or sightseeing.
I've had numerous training classes regarding use of these throw bags.  
My husband loved the fit and comfort of this - kept him warm on a recent ski trip.
Great accessory for when out and about being active and trying to enjoy a cigar.
These gloves are a little small, but they are very comfortable.
When this one dies, I will replace it with the same thing.
The grips are just as expected....great!  
I love these socks and have owned many pairs of them.  
Super simple and super affective.
Quality product overall, and without a doubt the only choice for a light up disc, but I do have to voice a few points.1.
you can't beat it for the price and it's the perfect size for the backpacking expedition.
My daughter hated that they look like boy pants.  
Kinda cheap but works!
I think this is their best product.
I really like the LimbSaver line of recoil pads.
METAL SEAT AND ALL.
Price is too high.  
I mixed a cup of this plus extra ramen noodles
The blue handle is nice and feels great.
I use this whistle when I work.
really chill, to strengthen fingers.
this product provides so many products with great protection, I have used this on car seats to my son's sneakers
On a recent trip to VA and NC we used the cooler off and on for a week to keep our drinks and picnic lunch items cool.  
This base works like it should, and I do like the idea of the "clear" base.
These really don't seem to cut as well as they should and the set screw on the countersink attachment fell out on my second hole (luckily i found it and was able to torque it in myself) but they work well enough to get the job done.
Husband is an ironworker an was very happy with the price and this tool for work he plans on ordering more
Really used it to keep squirrels and chipmunks out though.
I have a 12 foot tree and the base is very wide so this came in handy.
I can dado exactly.
Don't get me wrong, it works... and it's cheap, which is cool.
beautiful light for the price I do not think you will go wrong.i put them on a new shed and they are really nice
If you looking for precision I am sure there are better guides out there for twice the price,
The biggest drawback to the bag is its length.  
Perfect.
SOME PEOPLE COMPLAIN, THEY DON'T LIKE IT, TO ME IS BETTER THAN THE ELECTRONIC COUNTER PART,I CAN SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING, IN THE CIRCUIT
I do not know where I got the idea that these knives were compatible with Delta 4 inch jointers, but they simply do not fit into the head.  
One other thing....these pieces look like they cost a lot more than they did.
The tools are easy to move when needed, and solid when set in place.
A GREAT FEELING TO HAVE A SPARE BULB.  
We bought a house with an unfinished basement, I was building a list of supplies we will need to complete some walls put up insulation make it more family friendly and most important not so cold in the Michigan winters
Good but nothing special
Recommended over the RubberMaid version, because this can handle the range of temperatures in the central midwest.
Best blades I have ever bought.
I use these in an arboretum to prune limbs and cut roots for stump removal.
Pretty simple
Very heavy duty pliers
This is the recommended bulb for the 36V Dewalt flashlight as well, I've had mine in there for about 6months with no issues.
i gave this a shot; but did not work for my needs.
Their dimensions are spot on and it's a great weekend project.  
This is a good plane for occasional users and novices.
Broke pretty quick
Channellock - great quality
You'll need this plate to cover the Stanley 30418 timer/switch - unless you already have one.
Linking to the 10 year old opener was easy and according to the directions.
Great bit, well balanced.
I removed the old brushes and have many more hours of use before replacement needed.
Purchased these for my handyman husband who requested them.  
A great feature I was not looking for when I purchased the Mitre Box.
Will come back to seller; great service.  
I've used a lot of lights in my time, but I always have at least one of these in the truck.
This is a great tool that allows you to place nails accurately and well.
These don't fit my older Dewalt Miter saw
For those of us that do this for fun, this is definitly a "Best Buy".
Absolutely a good change.
Always handy and reliable.  
I needed to round the edge of a 1" piece of oak, and the rounding bit has a "shoulder" that needed to be above the work surface.
I am not an overweight person (180lbs), and I didn't even put my whole weight one this.
When replacing bathroom fans, the duct size can be extremely important.
Not much of a review to be given for this product.  
Yes its plastic, plastic is not as durable.
Added this to my outside pool for the filter ... works perfect.
Quality as expected.
I have a thing on my pool that works like a toilet.
This is the perfect case to hold puzzles!
Gorgeous replica of the SR-1.
I bought this for my special ed kids and they enjoyed it.
Love this game, arrived on time, great time with friends
We love cranky and this is such a cute crane.
Creates vibrant colors and such lovely pictures.  
The pieces are great, the cards and board are great, and the kids (even the 6 year old) love to play!
I bought the Operation game as a gag gift for a friend's husband who was having surgery,  He'd already gotten all kinds of magazines and books and I thought this might give him a laugh.  
A very fun game which emphasizes negotiation and backstabbing between players.
I wasn't sure how these would go over since they got mixed reviews but my 4 year old things these are the best thing since sliced bread.  
This kit is just an awesome thing for your entire family.  
He likes having his own garden tools.
Nice game to play with adults or children or combination of both.
As with all Ty Beanie Babies, the quality of this stuffed toy is good.
The biggest negative is that balls of a similar size but tad bigger from older Fisher Price toys fit in the ball popper, but once in can not get out without taking the toy apart.
I was with the kids and we had a chance to play it and it was very fun so I purchased it.  
He is now almost 15 months old and this remains a favorite toy.  
It has torn a little bit by the door, but other than that it is ok.  
My 5 year old loves playing with this!!
She loves being like Mommy, and swings the purse over her arm as we get into the stroller.  
He loves it and it is so cute watching him play with it.
Play QUIDDLER!!  
it is even cooler in person!
gave it to my coworker who needed it.now we get colorful exclamations, eye catching.suddenly our documents look not so professional.
Good quality, as expected for a TY Beanie Baby.
They also like the "tink-tink" sound of the porcelain.
The markers don't work well with coloring pages.
This wagon appears to be comfortable for my grandson, but I would like to have a little foam seat cushion.  
I didn't read any of the other reviews, before or after my purchase, this is solely based on my son's and my experience.
A great game.
Still on the hunt for a better organizational system for wooden puzzles.
Colors are good.
My son still loves it
I noticed on the company website in late July that they have suspended shipments due to hot temperatures and will start again when it cools off.  
I was looking for the bigger ones.. still cute....
She's 10 now, and she still loves to play Totally Gross!
The colors and the quality are great.
It adds dimensions to the regular game, and multiplies the game's replay value several times.  
He keeps pulling out the sound card which makes it hard to read the books to him.  
Bought more at hoblob for like $3.
The truck is nice looking and nicely put together with good fit and finish.
We got these for my daughter and she was over the moon.
A tip for anyone who does have or buy this tub: cut the bottom off a clean gallon milk or water jug to fill the tub.
A great game.
Overall seems like a great quality toy.
Great battery.
there were 6 of them.\, only one survived to become a butterfly.
This was a huge disappointment.  
Kids love it, it's a quick easy game with simple instructions.
Toy was great for the three weeks that it worked.  
The other great feature is that it accepts game saves.
but hey still got to play this Grade A game.
Sonic got a new look and a whole new level of appreciation.  
Great game, worth your buy if you find it.  
So if you want a game that's like Pokemon with a awesome twist, by this game!
This is not an easy game, but not too difficult.  
Get this if you like Time Stradegy Games, Military, and good games.
in any of three different cities:  San Francisco, London, or Tokyo.  
This video game is awesome, the graphics aren't even that bad.
Super Smash Bros. Melee, arguably the best overall game for the G.C.N.  
It is simply one of the best games ever made and already a timeless classic.
Great item Great price!
The music and sound effects are great and the game story is good.
When you control sonic the game is fun, but you are not given the option to be sonic the whole game
I thought the image of the character floating face down in the water wasn't appropriate for younger kids.
Also, it's one of the best.
To find this game new and unopened is a challenge glad I did This is one of my top favorites in the Genesis Titles
In my opinion, this is the best of the many Ratchet & Clanks...I have replayed it 3 times.
Sony has really over priced there ps2!
And this is not to say the plot is horrible in this game; far from it.  
Slow loading, Bad graphics, and terrible games.
Cool guns, D)
So, I like this game because it's a gold cartridge and the gameplay is undetectable.
All-in-all, this formula works, though it's not yet perfected.
Game works so far, no complaints yet.
It's great to see a game that can actually mix these two puzzle games from the NES.  
Despite these detractions, it's still an excellent device overall.
This is a great game with excellent graphics and story plot.  
I got this game thinking it would be the coolest, and it turned out to be alright, but not suberb.
but it was pretty good.
This game was made and published by Sony(Japan) and brought over to the United States.
It's child's play compared with the old time Tetris.  
You should definitely play this game.
It's better in every since of the word.
Buy this if you liked Lotr!(Lord of the Rings)!
that stupid contorller is soo big, it won't fit anywhere.  
Multilayer deathmatch.
I loved this game when i first played it.
This was my first sixteen bit game.
Then you can decide which one is better!!
I bought this game a couple months ago and I absolutely love it!
I just bought this for the GBA, and for some reason, I prefer this over the chopped up version on my SNES.
The control  mechanism is quite easy to get used to and makes it enjoyable to play.
This game is a must-buy.
the gamecube dosent have a lot of good games but there are good games coming for it.
Though I have not finished this game, I can say that it is considerably larger than RE-2.  
Very cool stuff indeed.
Beautiful, even.
Not that it's not good or anything, it's just not as good as I expected it would be.
Ignore my others for this game.
