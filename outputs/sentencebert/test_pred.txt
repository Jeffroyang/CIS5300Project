Quick movements and footwork are so easy in these sneakers.
Now she loves me more.
No pockets and huge, the bottom of the pants go over shoes
Very good value.
Super cute shoe however runs wide and big, I'm a size 10 however this size 10 is too big.
I love these capris!  
Love these sneakers.
These shoes have a narrow base which I really like.  
Nice for lounging in around the house.
Love these!
Serves intended purpose
I feel like this pair of shoes was made for my feet.
Great price too.
Quick tranasaction!!!  Loved the shoes!!!  
Super comfortable and fit my small feet perfectly.
Comfortable, consistent each time I order and good looking
Would recomend
I used this for a costume and it worked well.
So light and comfortable.
Best tennis shoes I've had all my life.
Nice pants but too small for a medium.
These are as far as comfort goes the most comfortable pair of sneakers I have I suffer from sciatica pain that goes into my feet I have difficulty finding the proper support and comfort in shoes I would recommend these most definitely.
That being said the pants fit as expected and are comfortable.
Fit as exoected.
Not a fan.
i really like them
My favorite workout pants.  
So comfortable and soft.
The smell only lasts for a couple of hours after the shower but it leaves your skin soft and smelling great :) the pheromones that are infused certainly puts me in a better mood whenever i use it.
The lather is perfect.
I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture.
Love this companies soaps.
It is a thick shampoo and I do like that it bubble good and smells decent.
Just by itself it won't take care of calluses.
either way it's a good buy!!
The soap does a good job cleaning and seems to last.
I'll certainly buy more of this excellent shampoo when I finish the bottle I have now.  
My aunt loves it!  
What a disappointing product.
Yes, it's a foodie smell, but this one I like.
Love this product!
Maybe I got an old bottle, because it's awful.
I highly recommended the product and think it would be a great addition to any home medicine cabinet or first aid kit
My hair looks a little courser (nice), and I get great volume.
I will note the price differences first.
Lathers well, great fresh scent, natural oils, long lasting  All of Le Couvent des Minimes products are winners!
I love it!  
A little goes a long way so this product is a good value.~
I love the smell and the product.
Pre de Provence Soap, Milk, is a fantastic soap.  
There is an extra brush head holder for different models of brush heads (Oral-B-FlexiSoft and FlossAction and most Sonicare models).
I love these soaps.
This Bath and Body product is seasonal but I just love it and use it all year.  
Making waves curl defining shampoo really is great for my perm.  
Lavender fragrances vary and I have to say this is not one of my favorites  a bit too perfumey for my taste.  
And at the small price the best bargain in town.
The 3 rotating heads really adjust to the contour of the face and they snap open for easy clean up with water.
Great buyProduct works very wel;l.  
This cream smells incredible and has made my skin so soft.  
So glad I did
Stops man stink in its tracks.
This looks like mousse, but it's not.  
Product received exactly as described, in perfect condition and  on time.  
It's fresh and clean and brightens the entire room.
I find this a great buy.
Love this product!
This is my absolute favorite.  
The price is pretty comparable.
It is truly a wonderful shampoo
The oder is the most important as people must like it
The AXE MUSIC is The Best Ever.  
It does a great job as far as color goes but didn't leave my hair as soft.
Made me look older, it was the opposite.
Their stock will probably run out too, But for the time being I'm thrilled to have my favorite fragrance available.
This body wash smells amazing.
These are excellent DE blades that provide a comfortable, smooth shave for me.
Very good product & would purchase again.
Frequently get compliments on my beautiful shiny hair, great shampoo
Cheap fix for an old washer; take the agitator off, put these in, replace the agitator, and you're back in business.  
Best price I could find on the internest.
I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.
piece of garbage switch set to high that it will not shut off, couldn't return because it was taken out of package how else do you know if it will work if you don't take it out and try it.
Looks great.
Consider the wisdom of spending a lot of money on replacement parts for a 10+ year old washer that you originally bought for $400.
Works great.
the spin clutch is a wear part on WP built top loaders so this clutch kit takes care of a slow spin issue and at a great price.
It doesn't fit.  

Does the job, but make sure to get refills in other colors for those white colored fabrics....
The Masters Brush cleaner is always excellent
A good set!  
highl;y recommend this prduct.
Relatively easy to work.  
The wooden carver uses a small wood dowel to hold the nibs in to carve.  
Great bottle of paint in a color I needed.  
I will like it even more when I can understand how to use the gray scale section.
I love Boye knitting needles.
This comes up when searching for glow in the dark but doesn't glow at all
The Fun Fur yarn made the scarf look so luxurious.
For some reason (probably because I didn't read the product description carefully)
Another necessity for my inventory of tools.
Not much to say about these dies; Spellbinder dies always seem to perform well.
The Gold Leaf color is just beautiful!
Love the shape too, very comfortable to use.
But the coverage was far less than I expected - this 12oz was barely enough for a very small table.
I have several of these and they come in so handy.
Pretty pink color
Great color and texture.  
But the paint it self is great.  
color is much lighter than it appears online and when order arrived the one skein was frayed and unusable
Worth every penny.  
Better than expected, great in low light.
Take care when using the ruler, I did not notice at first that there is an extra half inch on two of the sides but it was my first time using a rule like this.
the rubber itself is really good quality.
I love all of these paints.
It's nontoxic & glows but it has to be really dark.
I love all three, but never was able to develop the skill to free hand camouflage patterns reliably with my Krome.  
Thus, they look good on top of markers (and will look a little different over different colors) and they look great alone.  
Many quilters had warned me that a Dresden quilt can be difficult but I didn't have any problems with this tool and my quilt looks great.  
This pigment ink is TERRIFIC.  
Impossible to get gradation - I get better results with crayons
Hard for me to find this item in perfect condition except from Amazon since so many label making varieties receiving more publicity.
All my students say these are their favorite art supply.
charcoal pencils don't work well, as well as the kneaded eraser and other pencils.
Because all my other Gingher products are great.
I bought this for fashion sewing, not quilting, and I'm finding it much easier to use a rotary cutter for thin/delicate fabrics that shift around a lot.
It is great if you need to keep a small amount of supplies which will last a while without having to purchase more blades.
The ring sizer and mandrel are both plastic, they work great for the wire rings I make.
It is so nice to have a big handful of these around instead of having to make my own ear wires when I have a lot of earrings to do.
These have been a good value and my daughters have several packs that they use to enhance their drawings.  
It seemed fine but in less than a month the metal legs, which seem thin for their use, simply separated at the connection.  
I like bamboo needles and these are top of the line... nothing better than Clover brand, in my bag of tricks!
great  quality.
Great for someone who has arthritis like I do.  
I used to pin my knitting and crocheting out with lots of pins.  
Very easy to work with, and the spools are very handy ways of dispensing it and keeping it from tangling and kinking, preventing waste.
I've been crocheting for over 50 years and splurged to buy this crochet hook.
I love the color!
Perfect for underhood weather-resistant power connections directly to the battery.  
Good price.

I bought to replace my old set ,this kind had been use in my boat and I love this set.
Heavy duty and accurate, that's all you need!
My filter is a little hard to examine, so I'm glad that I will not have to disassemble the air box as often.
Very good connector at a decent price.  
Perfect fit for 1995 wrangler and easy to put on roll bar
This is by far the best wheel cleaner you can buy.
Decent product.
Built good, it should last a long time.
Great products.  
either way, i love the panoramic mirrors, they work a lot better than standard factory rear-view mirrors.
I read some of the reviews, high and low.
It was also a great value for the money.
DO NOT use a universal bracket.  
I did leave a blue rag on top of it that was wet and it turned the absorber blue!
They are really made of great quality.
I hardly ever use these for their designated purpose and I can not break them ,that's the kind of tool I love to buy .
People stop by the RV and ask how I got it looking so good.  
and it works great.  
Easiest way to protect lower body, and hides minor flaws in the finish
This is a simple cable, it will not stop a crime but it will keep the wind from blowing your cover all over the parking lot
Great product at a reasonable price.
Other than that, it saved me alot of time, and my stereo sounds great.
Great cover for the money.
Work Great on my 1990 Rivera
overall a decent light duty rack
The problem is the one gallon kit says to get another quart if you have an eight foot bed on your truck.  
Great to deal with fast shipping and perfect fit .
Worked for me.
Cheaper ones fell apart.
Work as advertised.
Great club and fit fine on a 2003 F150 Supercap
So if you have, for example, an aluminum intake manifold that you's like to keep looking new, this clear coat works like a champ.
Seems like it will do the job as an indoor car cover, however, I was shocked at how rough the material is.
You most likely buy this tool to help remove panels/trim inside your car in a safe way without scratching your car or damaging the trim.
I love these mufflers.
I highly recommend this tool, best $120 tool I have ever bought
Silblades are the best, love them!!!
Worked very well.
I have others and they work great.
Gave them to the neighbor I don't like.
Waste of money.
Haven't tried it yet on a Tonneau because what the hell is a Tonneau?
This is the best thing to assure that your cooling system doesn't leak, and to get all of the coolant into the system without including air.
it did not work well for me, didn't put out a good light beam pattern, i only use it for like 1 month and gave it to a friend
Works great.
That was a nice surprise.
It is the best of it's style I have found, however it is not durable
In a sense, it is kind of the anti-Huck Finn.
Much easier to navigate than previously purchased Bibles.  
What writing.
The children loved this book.
I wanted the "Americanized play."
i find his books difficult to read & require a 2nd reading...the tv series has made it so much easier to understand...but, i'll always give the books a try
Which is only one of the many things I didn't like.
I am sorry to give this book a poor review.  
Thank you, it's a wonderful book, a good read.
Wow, the story just keeps getting better and better.
Though some lingering annoyance at the slowness of the plot in this book, I enjoyed it more than I thought by the end.
The series started out great and pulled in you with the characters and the story lines.
A little dark as are several of Gaskell's novels, but a lovely story that deals with class conflict, personal crisis, and, of course, love.
Amazingly, I actually liked Miss Marple in this story.  
Better poetry has never been written in all of literature.
This is one of my TOP 5 favorite books of all time.
I am reviewing calculus again today.
Not really like a run-of-the-mill TV series at all.
This is a well-structured, easy to read book.  
Will the next generation flounder or flourish?
Friendly, helpful nanobots are not going to hold anyone's attention for long.
"Seeing is not believing--it is only seeing."I
I absolutely loved the first three books in this series.  
Various supporting characters grace the pages, from Father Time, to Aslan the Lion, and even Reepicheep the Mouse, each giving beautiful insight and wonderful understanding.
This and Storm of Swords are my favorites in the series, but they are all good.
An absolutely beautiful collection of stories and thoughts.
The book seems to endorse this idea that the two must  remain in their self-enforced isolation, but for no apparent reason.  
This is a great Bible for a good price.
The four part series that BBC did on this book was so good I watched it over and over again.
The Eleventh Commandment belongs in Archer's head, not on paperback.
Having read the 6 preceding books, I would say  it was predictable in some ways, particularly with the character of the characters.  
It was my first Allende novel.  
If you love dark vampire tales read Bram Stoker's Dracula.
A classic.
Barron's books are the best when you want your kids to understand Elizabethan English.
Vintage Clancy  Very good
The language reflects a bygone age, difficult to assimilate.
this book is a classic for all children hungry for an adventure.
Cornwell has written other historical fiction that are not "Sharpe" books and I did not like them half as well.
The book was ok but boring for a lot of it.
Thoroughly traces Hemingway's whole life from birth to shotgun finale.  
It is a decent size and the font size is perfect.
While not for everyone, I love this
You won't be disappointed!
Please keep sharing these wonderful books.
There is heartbreak and sadness and inconsolable pain in these characters' lives.
Enjoy!
Read as a kid and loved.  
This book is a vast, sprawling, out-of-control mess that needs a good editor.  
I expected to like this book more than I did, given all of its critical acclaim.
Much nicer.  
Good result.
I'm glad I've replaced it with the CD
It was clearly a master stroke.
The staging is excellent and I could find absolutely no faults with this record.
Not one of the new versions of the songs are as good as the originals.
Unlike other reissues (The Beatles) the vinyl is super quiet.
I love 2 become 1 and Mama.
This DVD could have been a lot better because there are tons of concert footage shown during every song.
PS: this release comes from the original guitar-heavy lineup, which still featured awesome guitarist Duane Allman.
The flipside of Beechwood 4-5789
Absolutely wonderful!
Songs like "Best I Can," "Beneath, Between and Behind" and "Anthem" epitomize young Rush at their finest.
All in all, "Burn My Eyes" is one of, if not the, finest metal debut of all time.  
This one stands as one of the best visual representations I've ever seen of what it's like to be a musician.
Twista has been my favorite rapper since 1992 and I can feel his music every track on this CD.
And it's not weird, it's art!
One of the best Marvin Gaye dvd out there it contains the 11 minute 52 second version of Got to Give it Up!
This collection was easily one of the best DVD/musical investments I've made in a long time.  
The best track is the hit song  Track 2 Achy Breaky Heart is an enjoyable,danceable, and good country song.
I can't say that I love all of it, but most of it is certainly very, very good.
Excellent females voices from the golden era from the soul classic with the love unlimited orchestra and Barry White of course.
Because this record doesn't contain any rockers like "Reelin'in the  years", "My Old School",or "Black Friday."
Que suerte tuvo esa gente de Tokio de estar en ese concierto!.  
Best track for me: Join the army, a little each day, the prisoner, war inside my head, i feel your pain, possessed to skate, no name no words, looking in your eyes.
"Borateen" is the album's strongest cut in my opinion, and I like the jazzy feel to "Big Important Nothing".
The other songs are listenable, but not exceptional.
It's almost like a death in the family, er at least derived from personal observations.
absolutely terrific!
"I love it loud' was the worldwide "hit" on this one and it's a great song with a really cool video.
Some incredible guitar in this song.  
They're one of the few bands who're just as good, if not better, in person.
Simply put, this is great.
Anything produced by Eddie Kramer is a good bet.
To me, the four primarily acoustic albums that Rod the Mod turned out between 1969 and 1970-something, remain the best items in his entire catalogue.
wow, what a night....
Korngold's score is that good.
This one is Mama's favorite vacuume up the den album.
"There's not one cut that isn't pure gold,and Carly's vocals are perfect.
Nice to be able to get old music on tape and this is a great old tape.
I thought I would love this because of all the great reviews.
Every track on this album smokes like a full house of  college kids in a coffee shop.
This CD is for open-minded people only, do not attempt to listen if you are a sheep.
2112 is the best song on the album!
Layers of dense sounds and The Edge's jarring guitar effects brilliantly convey/enhance the mood of each song.LYRICS:
Great!
POP offers some of U2's best work.
Music bands come and go.
the arrangement  and groove is  real  cool.  
"Unforgettable Fire" is breathtaking along with its etheral  keyboards and piano.  
Belt clip is very secure.
Good quality and perfect fit.  
Love the floral design but the only thing I could complain about is that one of the holes on the side doesn't line up that good (the one to mute the sound).
The commuter case of otter is great.
So i just received my micro sim cutter today about two hours ago and i was very exited to try it, well let me tell you that it did not even cut a single simcard when the sheet metal or aluminum or whatever cheap steel they used to make this cutter bent and did not cut my first sim card, very dissatisfied, i wish i would have picked a different one from Amazon and i hope the seller gives me a full refund this is by far the worst product i have ever bought!!!!!
It's done a great job keeping my phone charged.
I love the concept.  
This package includes the MQN06.
Overall, I am glad I purchased this particular case.
They were/are very comfortable around my big head.  
Bought it unlcoked and usinng it currently in Colombia.
I love these screen protectors there awsome
HTC does not consider Amazon a legitimate market place.
This thing is great.
This product is fine and it seems to charge up a completely dead phone better than the common cheap little plug-in cubes with USB cable.
This is a phone holder is very neat.  
Only draw back is that the back cover has a square that is positioned in an odd place makeing it hard to do anything with it while it is lying on it's back/
Ripping MP3s and slow load make the Treo not a great music player.
The case is a good fit and doesn't add much thickness to the phone.  
Stores all my Microsoft Zune accessories perfectly
However, when it was installed, it did **look** impressive.  
Most importantly, it works just fine: connects the N8 to my PC & charges it.
No more wear and tear on the usb data pins , need I say more.......
It works not the best, not the worst.
This is the micro USB used for many devices.
I lost this cable but when I had it, it worked like a charm, never bought another one because I tried other products.
Is this a cell phone I love I actually love it and so will you I highly recommend it.
To be fair, the audio sound quality is pretty good for the price...in the right ear.
I drive a lot and need these.
Was exactly what i want, and it works perfectly i can recommend this product to other people who need one of this
why is there a limit?
I love this item.
It was easy to set up and pair with phones.
I bought that phone for one of my friendsAnd he said it was very goodThe sipping time take longer than I expect,
Only issue that I have is the cup holder part keeps coming loose.
My phone saw a fair share of abuse and this case always protected it.
I rely on ZAGG for my portable devices.
It seemed like a great phone but ended up being one of the bunch with an innumerable number of failures, however naive in my country are wishing for.
This screen protector works like in the advertising, really good and useable, but your screen become a little bit blur!!
Not much of a sound loss or any such issue.
los felicitosme llegoen poco tiempolos felicitosamigojose coronadodesdevenezuelamas finook .....
If that isn't important to you, this is a great case at a great price.
Do not waste your money on this product!!!!
While the sound is terrific and all else is quality, the little ear hooks are extremely breakable and cannot be replaced, rendering it a waste of money.  
As always i'm glad to reiceve any packages in my mail slot, i opened up the cute packaging for the screen protector and immediatly applied them to my iphone 4s, the protectors are cute a little akwardly.
Looks and works like the original cable.
My phone now stays charged for well over a day.
Doesn't overheat any more then usual, and everything seems to be in order.
I would highly recommend for anyone looking for a nice cheap case.
This results in the case/pouch being slimmer, more easier to handle and lay down and more comfortable when placed in the pants pocket.  
and i can wear them all-day.
Love the shoe!!
Awesome shoes.
I'm 5'6", and the crotch fits a little lower than I'd like.
I believe he and his mother were happy with them.
I had bought small,which is what I usually wear, but I think I would have fit in there twice...
Good Wrangler product -- continue to fit as expected!
Chucks i wear 10.
The racer back is a nice change and does provide some level of support.
These are decent but you could find better quality.
Good quality for what I use it for
but I still don't understand why this got such good reviews.  
I love this sneaker.
This watch is fine.
A happy customer, Louella.
Really like these shoes, they help my arches and make me walk easier, ease to put on without a shoe spoon or binding over, that helps my back.
This watch stopped working after a few hours.
Am able to wear while sleeping.  
Love my Tango bra's!  
Bought as a gift.  
pretty comfy fit and fairly warm fabric for the winter I was wondering to get longer sleeve shirts but these were good enough.
Love Time-teaching watches for kids.
Super fast shipping by amazon though.
I did order a size larger to begin with as I had tried on a similar pair and the closed toe design had a better feel going up a size.
Classic Carhartts.
But otherwise it fit good
Don't buy unless you enjoy throwing away $10.
This was a super great buy for me!
A great product that keeps my neck warm on cold days.
Other than the annoying pointy cups it's a good fitting bra.
My favorite style of shoe.
it is soft and comfy.
Easy to put together and use.
Otherwise it is a wonderful watch!
Got the yellow as a gift for the wife and they fit as expected.
Love this bra for summer.
The sneakers look great and they fit great and comfortable.  
I wear a 11 in 95% of my shoes
My old shoelaces were wearing out fast, and these are very good replacement laces.
These are the only jeans my husband will wear.
Fits on my narrow feet and comfortable for all day.
Great shoes for someone with fallen arches ( overpronators).
Same great quality as always
I love this watch in fact this is my second one I've bought for myself
Nice and soft material.
Loved the shoes.
I still prefer the Roth version but find the Buxton wallet to be a good substitute.
I love Converse All Stars and have been a loyal customer for years.
They look great on, fit well and are very comfortable for him.
I love Keen shoes!!!
I liked it right away, I had to buy it.
Yuk...
It was nice just to add it to my MP3 collection.
I have only heard one version of this song and it's on this Greatest Hits album.
This is one of my favorite songs by Whitney Houston.  
One down 15,000 to go!!!
Before Badfinger used a similar guitar effect in 'No Matter What" there was Badge.  
I see it as a great song that could have been cheesy but is entirely successful at avoiding that categorization.  
I Love Alan Jackson!  
The pain was unbearable.
This is just one of many songs by Todd, that reflects the mans unique and creative songwriting talent.
Dido put a lot of love in her songs.  
Outstanding!!
I absoltuely LOVE this feel-good, positive and up-beat song.
The beat and music is to cool for school.
Dio is the best!
I still love the song..but dropped the man
The emotive writing combined with the cautiously-tempoed synth sounds create a swelling sense of bittersweet love.
Metallica's second best album mostly due once again to Mustaines amazing songs.
Glad to be able to get this song!
This is an old time favorite from back in the day every one should have it in their collection.
so Now i have to fiand this movie .
Quality is clear as well.
I don't know if Lionel Richie counted on this song spanning the ages and becoming a classic love song that would be played at weddings and dedications when it was written and performed with Diana Ross for the original movie Endless Love, but that's where this song has landed and helped him to branch out from The Commodores into his successful solo career.
Great song, great band and a little bit of nastalgia
Judy Jacobs is a truly gifted singer and I cannot think of another artist who could perform this song with the power thatJudy can.
I love it, great feel good music!!  
Like this one a lot!  
I have enjoyed this song by Josh Turner.
Great song...I would rather hear than watch this orchestra...the music for the most part is extra-ordinary.  
we like this song too!!
And best of all, it isn't classical music, it's rock.
Hmm I would say they wilted and died from this boring song.
I love the bass that opens it and Jorma's snakey guitar lines, and quasi bolero rhythm.
Best song ever
It's sad that with an independence like this, the freedom that an artist has is lost when dealing with the majors.
A wonderful song!  
It's so easy to buy and download music from Amazon Music, whether it's albums or singles.
This is an absolutely perfect song.
i love this song what it takesSteven Tyler sings it so welli would deffinitly recommend this songthank you amazon...
Did listen to the original,which is a lot of fun too--by Barbara Lewis.
These female rock stars were goddesses that ruled the decade.
Super Sessions is a pretty unique album.  
I loved this movie and the sound track for the movie.
Just a great 80's song.
The whole album is great.
Lorrie, like me, has very eclectic musical tastes and it shows in her choice of material.
Now I'm blasting it doing the pre-party cleaning, and feeling very blessed and proud to be 'Living in AMERICA '!
One of the best country singers
Now I can listen to the best
Great power for concerts and plays and compact to carry with you anywhere.
it's good
Total junk.
Belkin makes good stuff.  
Very comfortable, even if you're wearing glasses.
I ordered 2 of these,I got them on time & i think i found them a few bucks cheaper herethan i did at a few other places.working great.
a little to much
While they do offer good sound, they were too uncomfortable to wear for longer than 5 minutes.
I was having problems burning DVDs in my Macbook Pro SuperDrive.  
Good construction and works as expected.
Awesome low freq definition.
The quality of the Tiffen filter is excellent and it does the job.
I try to plug it to a Bose speaker made just for Iphone / Ipod and did't work at allTry with a source from a Macbook, Galaxy, Iphone, Lumia and IpadIt sucks
would be a great solution for someone with a smaller camera, though.
Always nice to see manufacturers maintain a standard and format for so long in this disposable world.
Classic headphone has pretty good sound, with pretty strong bass, surprising for an on-ear design with no seal against the ear.
So I went looking to local retailers for a suitable cable.  
Protect your glass, this UV filter works great..
I used it to connect my turntable to a small amp I built into some customer bookshelf speakers.
The sound quality of this machine is fine for recording nature sounds
The sound from these is AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING.They almost rival the sound from my Sennheiser Momentums - almost.
Just for maintenance to keep eye lens clear of any dirt/dust after using it on all of 3-5 items their was a coat of dust/dirt on disc.
This cable is of usable quality.
A great filter.
broken after exactly a year, won't format / write / erase
This product was a wondferful product and helped me a lot when i had to take pictures from far distances.
Just needed a clear protector but when I saw this kit I was happy to purchase the two other lenses.
A couple of ports are no good.
Good sound quality
This lens gave me some very nice pics and if you working on a budget this is the lens for you.
This is a great product, as you can see from the other reviews.
Very good radio.
The thing about this lens is the greatest asset of the lens is also the greatest weakness.
Shipped fast, seems to work allot better than that crap I bought from another seller, no dragged out intro, gets right to what it is suppose to do THANK YOU!!!!!
Great cable.
I don't particularly like the feel of over the head plastic bands on headphones so if I were to rate the product for exactly as it was intended, it would probably be a 4 star review, but for my needs they're fantastic at the price.
Not pleased with this filter at all.  
Thought the vendor deserves a positive review but really do not have that many words about a good power cord.
Works Great!
The build quality is better than I've ever seen.  
If I plug this in all the way into the jack, you can hear the music, but the vocals are way tinny like they're coming from another room.
They sound great but they are a little too uncomfortable.
A good broadband Anti Reflection coating will pass 99.4% minus any absorption within the glass itself.
There's not much to say other than the sound is great and the headphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.
That works like a champ.
I would like these to be around forever.
Also works great with books, magazines, in the car, at the movies, basically also as a general flashlight.
The Tiffen has a stout metal ring and crystal clear glass, nice.
These are the best batteries you can get for your digital camera that uses AA batteries.
These headphones are almost as good as good as my monster headphones that cost 30 times more.
Great for a quick gift for a party.  
A Great Choice for someone who has everything!  
I ordered one of these when the egift certificate I ordered never arrived at my friends' email.  
Great way to do it.
This gift card was timely received in good condition & was properly credited with the amount indicated.
P.F. Chang's is soooo good and I love the environment there.
BE CAREFUL.
This even after the payments I'll end up making is far better than freezing or being hungry.
Gift..
Very convenient, works like a charm.
great gif for graduate..
!Always good to give an Amazon Gift Card!
Basically $10 for free.
Good idea.  
Future egift cards great ideal come on email you print out or not and never expires
She was very happy to get it!
She was very happy.
What else needs to be said.
I think almost everyone should be able to find something on Amazon they either like or love.
Was suppose to get to me in a day took 4 days lol, still good.
This will make the perfect gift for those family members who live out of town and you want them to have the choice of great make-up or perfume.
Great deal during the holidays when you can get it for $40 and can be upload to your Samsung Pay device so no more lugging around a gift card.
Worked as it should
Never heard back from the recipient but it was nice.
We all love going there for an occasional lunch or quick dinner.
Always a great gift for any one, any time.
We buy these in packs to take the grandkids to the move theater and they love deciding what they are going to watch and buying their snacks.
I bought this item for my niece last Christmas and she said it worked as described
This was a gift for an 11 year old.

Love amazon gift cards!
Super cute!  
Great Gift!
Worked as advertised
Bought as a lightning deal and received it promptly.
I like the fact that they come in a multi pack.
Teenagers love Wendys
I chose this Red Lobster card because I've eaten so well whenever I've gone there.
My friend-----the "handy man"-----lives THOUSANDS of miles away...GIFT CARDS are an easy way to send $$$ to my friend... without anyhelp from Western Union.
she will like to order.
Great gift
Gift....they liked it.  :-)
I gave this gift card to my sister for her birthday and she was sooooo excited!!!  
you actually want a review on a gift card?!?!?!
Great gift for Starbuck lovers!
After I gave the card to my wife for her birthday, we found the card far less convenient than a standard credit card.
So, I was very happy to see this.  
I give the gift cards to my grandchildren.
My son loves movies, this pack was a great deal for him.
Always a perfect gift, and the card was a beautiful way to display it!
love this product.  
Molina's is the best vanilla you can get for everyday flavoring needs.
Simply great yeast, and so economical!!!
I really like the ease of preparing for many of the quick dinners that happen and the taste is really good.  
Creamy noodles and Chicken flavor are so good, hard to beat.
Very smoky flavor, rich black color, not like any tea you've ever had before.
Salt is certainly not salt.  
I like food to live brand for this.
It's awesome.
He's so pleased...thanks for extremely cost effective gift!
Works as designed
Lovely in Chinese and Japanese recipes.
My favorite salty snack!
Good for nights when Dad has too cook for daughter on his own, but the broccoli sauce is more of a suggestion of what you might call the cheese sauce, and you can be sure that no broccolis were harmed in the making of this dish.
Always love Jif Creamy P-Nut Butter.  
My husband loved the Sugar Free Oreo Cookies.  
its sweet and salty.
I just tried my first tea bag today and I enjoyed the taste very much.
These are "iced tea bags" -- each bag is large and makes 2 quarts worth of iced tea.
Great product I use this weekly.
What a nice treat!
even though the date on the outer box says best by 2019 it taste extremely weak/old There is almost no mint flavor while drinking and a very very weak residual mint flavor after drinking this tea I have had this to you before and it was always very potent, im extremely disappointed will not buy from here again  either the product itself has changed or the tea is old
Super tasty, a bit of heat, but a convenient meal-in-a-pouch vs. a less healthy meal from a box or drive-thru.
(I also love the steak and noodles variety.)
Valerian caps or hops tincture work much better.
First time for trying Oolong tea and I really do like it Bigelow is a good brand of tea
For those who are on a diet, this tea "neat" is refreshing and sweet hot or cold.
Can't beat it!
I love this tea.
Great item, the images are a little off, make sure you realize t hese are the SMALL ones and not the long slim jims.. still if you manage to catch it at a good price its worth it...
i looked all over but saw no reference to the ingredient titanium dioxide in the reviews already posted, which is why i bought it.  
I was extremely happy with this purchase.  
and I think processed food may not be the best for me all the time.
I am astounded at the good reviews and wonder if they are real.  
the reason I thought I would try these is because some reviewers said they were fruity tasting with a little pepper taste.
I just received my second tin of the m&m's cookies..equally as good!
It is handy, and really good.  
I love this Furikake and put it on my rice all the time!
this tea is just wonderful!
When it comes to tea, Twinings is the best!!
These Tootsie Rolls Assorted Fruit Rolls are very good.  
My breakfast cereal along with blueberries most mornings.  
Very good!
Those boxes do contain the exact same foil wrapped package that the tins do.
This espresso is great but I must have read the size wrong because you can get this same size at the grocery store for half of the price.
This is my 2nd favorite tea and is difficult to find.  
I make some awesome cookies with this flour.  
If you're looking for a good candy at an economical price, I would recommend this package.
We buy the raspberry, chocolate, spice and vanilla flavors and both my husband and I drink several cups of these chai teas every day.
The flavor is nice and robust and doesn't get lost in the other flavors as I'm cooking.
This is a very nicely made, solid grinder.  
The rave reviews are right on.  
Works really well.  
Peels really good
Love the box though.
Hencklels are the best knives.
Feels good in the hand
It does exactly what it is supposed to do without a lot of bells and whistles.
It's difficult!!!!
It makes great espresso, i'm not into drinking espresso by itself, but love espresso drinks.
It's got great suction and the attachments make vacuuming a breeze, even under furniture.
Have always loved this classic line of cookware.  
It is great as a placemat for the inevitable fall out and it is also a great educational tool that keeps her busy while we are finishing our dinner.
Gets the greens dry in pretty quick order.
It is a great storage unit but seems as though there a 5 discs available for the Cuisinart, there should be additional slots.
I really like it overall.
I like using it.  
Great bowl, only thing I didn't realize is that it cant go in the microwave.
Broke after first use...
This has got to be the best bread machine on the market.  
These look great and are very very sturdy.  
we had one of these vacuums before and loved it until my wife turned it into a wet/dry vac which broke it.
Worth the investment for a dedicated baker!
My plumber advised a repetitive pumping motion, which is impossible with this product.
Bags are better.
I had this a long long time ago I really like this, and it pops almost all the kernels it doesn't waste.
Still 5 stars imo
I am able to get a good grip on the handle and spin the water out very easily and it is quick to take out the excess water and moisture on the veggies!
I have many older farberware pieces that I love and use all the time.
Better tasting espresso ....but gasket leaking...
How awesome it that!!
Still like new.
No more battling with what used to be a good product from swing away and is not any longer.  
I don't like this because it has a large  bump inside the top that mirrors the one you can see on top and it doesn't allow one to place as much lettuce as one would like or it will squish the lettuce.
They are allergen filtration bags and trap dust mites, mold and cat dander.  
The extra length of these really pays off.
Next Spare ribs, unlreal and tasty.  
I've followed cleaning instructions and it's easy to keep looking and working like new.  
Love Oxo!
All the cup measurements appear to be accurate, though we have not tested this.  
Other than that, great price and does what it says.
I opened box and checked them out  - they're very well made and look like they'll last a very long time.
This was exactly what I was looking for, and for an awesome price!
The caps on each end are a wonderful idea.  
It is now an enjoyable experience to open cans!
love anything oxo.
This can opener is sturdy and very easy to use.  
sucks better than I do lolol
I've tried two other cordless vacs, but this is BY FAR the best.
It is so great.
I used this for my fish tank, measuring water treatments to testing water.
The K-Type bladed connector is a pretty flimsy piece of plastic, but again, treat it carefully and it should last.
Fantastic tape, doesn't come undone/unraveled like other duct tape.  
But, for the price point i cant really complain, they work, and are better than some printed rollers i had.
They do a great job of helping the print stick to the bed.
I have placed them in several containers need to be kept fresh and so far they are working perfectly.
I'm just using it for around the house kind of jobs so it works well for me.
After having several specifically designed but cheap oil containers spill in my vehicles, this container is worth the price.
These are awful, awful products.  
The resolution is fantastic.
works great
Its so sticky...
I got black and green samples I can't wait to try out.
Some hold good and some does not (leather)
Trash can color vs performance is a non issue.
Perfect to guide drills or taps.  
Also nice feature- while it is cooking, let's say that you realize the cheese is not melting, so you need to add more time.  
This is a quality instrument, what you would expect from Mitutoyo.  
it is fairly soft and easy to use.
The original DLP chip lasted 8 years, but I think it would have lasted longer if it had this paste instead of the pad.
They are made from low density polyethylene so they are pretty much impervious to any liquid you will encounter.  
The adhesive is quite strong and doesn't seem like it is likely to fail in normal use.  
They are working great for storing.
A little hard to peel off without gumming up.
These are fine and there's not a thing wrong with them, so 4 stars is a fair rating because I do like them.  
As advertised, great product
Great File.
Awesome Purchase.  
storage tank to my tractors.
Ice cubes from the dispenser taste like... nothing.  
I love these little things!  
They seal under pressure and are easy to clean up and reuse.
I LOVE  PC  PRODUCTS!!
I didn't count them but for less than $5, they're definitely worth the price.
I use these blades for mycology work and they are great for me.
Not the best bearings for a fidget spinner, spin time kind of sucks, and all the bearings feel like there's some kind of grit in them.
Getting very good results.
Works great, solid connector, easy to use
I would recommend it as a very high quality.
works great
At first it was difficult to find out how it works, but now that I know it needs to be hold upside down it's a great duster!
These gloves arrived on time.  

All of the SSR's worked first time.
Works great, easy to see LCD...
Consequently, the 10-114 is better suited to my needs than the smaller/narrower 10-113.Also, I have no problem getting a #12 gauge copper stranded wire inside these even though they are designed for #16  #14 gauge wire.
STUPID STRONG - and that's why you want to buy this stuff
I highly recommend this tumbler to any reloader looking to reuse brass.
These work and the quality is good.
Don't let your halide bulbs burn out to the bitter end.  
I highly recommend it.
Excellent read.
This series is paranormal totally unlike the other books.
I have not read this book yet but I love being able to order books online for my phone or on the kindle fire.
I am in the process of reading all of Craig Johnson's books.  
Ellie finds a rather racy email intended for her rather straight laced husband and realizes that the picture perfect marriage she thought she had was anything but.
I loved Valkyrie, book 1 in this series.
Rivating...you can't put this book down... from beginning to end.
Ms. Mitchell has penned two heroes who, by rights, shouldn't be likeable, and makes them loveable.  
I have read thousands of books over the years and I must say that this book ranks at the very top of my list of favorites.
This is a great author!
but i like Seb.
I love Anne books.
Her power is seeing the future.
I initially thought this would be a really great read based upon the reviews.  
The Story</a>&nbsp;is a very good mystery.
I particularly like the short stories and, as an actor, the poetry.
It has such fun outcomes in the adventures of his characters.  
This is not a story to miss.
This second installment was as good as his first book (Desperate Times).  
I loved this book!
What an easy-going style!
The CEV translation is a very easy to read Bible and easy to understand.
I love the fact that her books draw you in.
This was a nice story of the wallflower getting the sexy guy.
An unlikely crew is led through the gates of hell, as depicted in "Dante's Inferno."
I liked this book best when Oscar was on stage but his family history, and the wonderful way this whole book was constructed, make for a compelling, memorable read.
It made me question what the definition of law enforcement's mantra of "doing our best".  
Highly recommend.
I would not recommend this book -- the author has created a "hero" who is a misogynistic alpha male who thinks he knows what's better for the little woman than he does.  
I did buy the next book and I am hopeful that it is as good as books 1-4.
Overall pretty good stories, but I wouldn't recommend reading them all together like I did.
A very, very good book.
This is a very fast Pace  book never boring.
This is the next story in the Valkyrie series, but is actually the prequel.
A failed suicide is the beginning of an ever more intriguing puzzle, where the protagonist describes her world, crazy from the beginning to the demonic end, in a shudderingly believable first person narrative.
This is one of those reviews I do not want to tell you too much in.
"You like it?"
What the hell happened to them?I loved the concept of the book, thought it would be wonderful but nothing was discussed or solved or figured out.
Well-written and fast-paced.
Sebastian is a hot, sexy man (demon).  
If you liked the first book in the series, I think you'll like this one.  
I thought Book One was funny, but I found this funnier.
Recommend this book to all who enjoy Navy stories.
This was an easy read.
It was pretty face paced.
Free.
I can't wait to read all the books in this series!!
This book was okay and had some decent stories, but was nowhere near as good or as funny as the first book.  
I cannot recommend it enough for fans of urban fantasy like Jim Butcher or Kim Harrison.
Given the price, this is a huge plus!  
This MEG21 skin care anti oxidant boost is supposed to work best in conjunction with a hydrating moisturizer.
My wife takes niacin daily as a supplement and experiences no side-effects and this cream was fine for her.  
And my sensitive skin is fine with it.
I'm a fan!
This color doesn't look good in two coats.
I like mousse over lotions.
I usually spend no more than $15 on hydrating moisturizers and stick to brands like L'Oreal and Oil of Olay.
This product is wonderful for my sometimes-dry skin.
Great shampoo.  
I am a fan of easy to use eyeliner pencils.
far, so good.
The pump dispenser is nice, and a tiny bit goes a long way.
cheaper than my favorite department store, I am beyond pleased.
Love this line, gives me great moisture without being heavy or greasy.
I did get a brightening factor for sure after several weeks, however my skin was overly sensitive to it.  
This cleanser is gentle and more like a lotion.
This moisturizer is good stuff, but I am not sure I have the kind of wrinkles that it is meant to work on the best.
This is a liquid concealer and it comes with a sponge tip applicator like you find in lip glosses.
The best shade and corrective tools are not easily selected from the array of available ones.
Great products, gentle and softly scented.  
On the hunt for the perfect mineral sunscreen that does not dry out my face.  
Cool design, nice and compact and love the included cleaning brush though.  
I really wanted to like this product since I am 49 and I have noticed bags under my eyes.
A Clear serum that left my face feeling amazing.
Nice sheer polish.  
If after using all 2 oz of this green apple peel I do see a noticeable difference in my skin, I'll edit this review.
Does exactly what it is supposed to do and foundation looks great all day.
Great product.
The right weight of lotion.
Depending on how much you dispense, it might last longer.
In any case to me it has a nice, warm, pleasant scent.  
I like that  it's a "5-free" polish.
Yes, it hydrates the skin very well, but not with satisfaction.
Now I'm sure that a big question people will have is "does it hurt?"
I love kissing my baby after bathing him with Medela products.
much.*When I used it on my eyelids, I used it as the 'glowy' background for my favorite eyeshadow.  
This is more expensive, but in the end, I use less than a tube every season so I don't mind the price for a much more pleasing experience and end result.
Perhaps this is a good option for people with sensitive skin or particular needs but I don't notice the difference.
Bottom Line:  I like this product line and overall this seems like a decent basic moisturizer, but it doesn't work for my skin type.
The mist is fine and spreads out well.
CLEAN White Woods is a lovely fresh scent that isn't overpowering.  
The blending tip works well, however it pulls a bit on the delicate under eye area which make me hesitant to use it, unless absolutely necessary to correct any mess-ups.
Not happy with this - and it's the condition it arrived in that's the problem.  
if the color looked anything like it does online.
The tiny light-gray, low-contrast lettering didn't make this easy.
This was a very nice makeup remover.
cord will burn through.
Great product, a bit expensive but otherwise recommended!
The 3/5 rating because I've used some really top products out there..but yes this is a good product....
I am a voracious reader of business periodicals.  
Husband loves this magazine, he looks forward to every month getting his new addition.
Just avoid Maxim.
I like puppies.
Good Housekeeping is a magazine I have received for over thirty years!!  
Got it to keep antsy teen girls occupied in the office reception room.
love this mag.....
Nice articles,pretty photos and some interesting recipes.
I still like the magazine BHG; however, I wasn't pleased with your service especially when it came to renewing subscriptions.  
Always some nice photo shoots, though they tend to go back to grungy a bit often for my taste these days.
Each thick issue was full of articles on everything from the latest scientific breakthroughs to gadgets you could build in your basement shop.
Well written and illustrated.
What to say, a fun magazine for car enthusiasts.
I really like this magazine.  
I do not approve of some of the ads for young readers in our school library.
However, I think they do a pretty darn good job and I have never finished an issue feeling disappointed.
Gift for teenage granddaughter.
super cheap subscription and easy to read layout on my kindle fire hd
I read a lot of magazines.
I won't renew this.
One of the most handy magazines that I get!  
Im so glad that I subscribed to Los Angeles magazine.
They had plenty of their own bits and pieces including, my favorite, Humor in Uniform, Life in These United States and Laughter is the Best Medicine.  
Gorgeous breathtaking vivid photography.
Beautiful ideas
"Bicycling" does this well.
Elle Decor lets me dream about what my home could look like if I had unlimited amounts of money.  
Its okay, but not much content - mostly what was worn where by whom.  
It's essential reading and an absolute bargain for the money.
Excellent snips of everything.
My chief complaint with the magazine is how formulaic the articles are.
It just wasn't what I was hoping for.
Great magazine with great recipes.  
Never fails to provide new ideas for decorating, good recipes, and interesting articles.
This magazine presents a comfortable semi-modern "country" look.  
Sister loves loves loves loves LOVES it!
From the decorating, to the recipes, and articles,  this is a wonderful magazine.
I always flip to the book reviews first.  
I like the photography, the personal stories, the gardening and decorating ideas, and most other aspects of this magazine.
This is a great magazine it is't just about the old country style of years past.
The homes that this magazines shows are usually realistic and always lovely.
you have a table that could be shown in this lovely magazine; a rule for "The Look" seems to be the absence of clutter.
What a bad attitude!
Affordable ($10 when on sale)- Concise- Assigns letter grades to reviews
Get this for a shot of happiness in your mailbox each month.
Personally I find the articles to be so well written in the New Yorker it is hard to put down.
Forbes:  Conservative viewpointBusiness week:
There's great advice on creating new looks with cosmetics and hair products.
So far have only received one copy of it.
It's about good food, prepared in the best possible way.
Gone but will never be forgotten!!
My husband and I had as surprisingly good time with this.  
This is the one movie that I really liked Brad Pitt in.  
Bought this to go with my son's good night story and he loves it.  
Not really worth watching unless you have a passing interest in what it's like to be completely whacked out on drugs.
Probably best movie Rutger Hower has ever done and one of the best by Harrison Ford.  
We really enjoyed this movie.
His wife plays the best annoying wife I have ever seen.  
Love this book!
One of the best sci-fi films I've ever seen.
Blade Runner would be my very close second choice.
Treat Williams and Whoopi Goldberg also star, they are great too in this.
You know Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin have to be good.
This movie is another one that falls into a favorite of mine... mostly for all the wonderful actors in it.. and.... how well they interact with each other.  
I watch the unrated DVD almost every week and it invariably never gets old.  
I have seen this movie twice and loved it both times.  
The Trailer played fine on my Device.  
At first I was just worried about getting the great movies that were released when I was young, like Aladdin or Beauty & The Beast.
Cool film!
Love Liam Neeson he was great in believing in what you and everyone wants IN life freedom to for your self and control to the right to do what for people to walk around and to have a great job it was sadness to see what people went through.
The seller was super quick and it was packaged great.
This just works best with the setting in England.
love kevin spaceylove Thomas newman music scorerecommend to all movie goers of all races in all countries now
Their trial is a bitter struggle for freedom.
The humor is  absurdist but good-natured, as in older-style films, and the supporting cast does standout service.  
If you saw the movie and liked it, you'll  love the Director's Cut.
"Roger Rabbit" is definitely a must for anime collectors.
His filmography bears me out.
Maybe Spielberg is the Walt Disney of the "Easy Rider" generation.
Oh my.  I never thought I could say this, but I just watched the best movie I think I have ever seen.  
It is painful to watch:  a horrible story about horrible people to whom horrible things will happen.  
love it and got here fast
This was pretty bad - I have to be more than a little irritated to take the time to write a review.  
it's the best.
I liked this movie, but it is a "chick flick".  
Classic thriller here.
I frankly don't know why so many reviewers rate this film over two stars!  
An excellent Bob Hope vehicle with Otto Preminger good fun as the head Nazi, Otto Fauscheim.
I understand the "rules" and like watching a movie that works well within it's own particular idiom.  
good news all the way!
Do you remember your acid trips?
The result, in both book and film, is painfully obvious; it can be done, but it's not that much fun to experience.
This doesn't feel much like a horror movie as much as a psychological thriller, but that really shouldn't repel anyone from this great film.  
Great Film That Shows The Range That Both Actors Display During This Film.
Great movie.  
This movie is one of the unknown greats in my opinion....
Pretty good considering I'm generally not a SciFi fan.  
And I am so happy to have it on Blu-Ray.
I can honestly say i got what I wanted from this DVD/Blu-ray Combo Pack!So
A great buy.
So the portability is very nice and it's easy to handle in all aspects of the process.
The Contego is more than good enough for the professional musician.
looks good, feels good, and most of all sounds great!
I don't really know if it's better than other brands or not.  
The sculptured grip is very comfortable and easy to grip so it won't get away from you.
Good music to all
It is all good quality and working fine.
Very nice bass strings for a 30" short-scale bass.
It works well, and beats having to put rivets in a cymbal that you could otherwise use for other things!
They get old fast and rust quickly, but they have a good acoustic tone
Perfect fit.  
It's a microfiber cloth, I can't do a happy dance review about a cloth.
I have tried all the rest and still had to revert to old school in order to get the best lighing on my stand.
While the pedal is flexible and has a few modes, I just couldn't handle the digital artifacts and synthetic sound.
I have had a Yamaha Recorder for 15 years.
I do wish it had an "ON," "OFF" switch.
Great finish and the neck feels right!!
Thump, thump!
It seems durable, sturdy and nice.
Using that trick, this little toy can get each lug to within 1 or 2 Hz of each other while you watch music videos, sports, or your favorite TV show.
I replaced the Schaller strap locks on my Strat with these.
I have two of these SM57.
I like it so far and it does what it is meant to do.
I put these on an inexpensive Fender guitar and they noticeably improved the sound of it.  
Works great, at a great price.
Clear and solid, plays great.  
Cheap in price not in quality.
They do sound fantastic, feel great, good resonance, but once the corrosion starts the sound quality and feel of the strings deteriorates quickly.
been using these for years, they work well and i will always use these as my everyday string.
Excellent quality with very good sound.  
The good outweighs the negatives in this case though.
Great and cheap.
I chose these due to price.  
Great sound I love these strings.
I realy like the cutter.
I like that it doesn't affect the tone of the instrument.
the kit is in a studio does not move, will work a long time used daily meets all my needs
For me the Mic is perfect for the situation.
Useful on the piano when it is closed.
Again, high kudos for great tone and durability characteristics.
The Bach 3C trumpet mouthpiece fits me perfectly.
Some lowlife stole my gig bag with all my slides and tools.
It fits my Les Paul Standard snugly and has back straps for easy carrying.
Fantastic for outdoor heavy metal gigs.
I love these picks.
its smooth to use and the sound is superb!
Personally, I'm an Elixir fan; I got used to the texture, and I love the tonal consistency.
Nylon won't break but may wear down with heavy use.  
Elixir makes the best quality strings that sounds great, both acoustic and electric, and last a long time.
This tool makes it really easy to work on stringing a guitar.
Perfect size for my needs since I label everything.
I like the variation in color on the paper.can't wait to use them in my classroom!
Great price and the labels worked fine.
I'm sure it works great with computers, filing systems, and even baseball card collections as well.
Excellent functions for the every day engineer.
Overall a good product.
Great buy if you need red pens.
I absolutely love this card board!
For a 'marker', the fine point just does not work.
The labels themselves are wonderful.......trying to find the right program/layout for printing the labels correctly, not so great!  
probably to mount some cute little LED hallway lights or something.
I like this size the best because it gives you more room to write.  
but it is nice quality
I only wish it came in much smaller bottles.
I like the plastic finish better than the paper.  
They were flimsy and barely thicker than a regular piece of paper.
It's hard to find an acceptable printer paper for an HP1022 Laserjet because most papers I have tried have a problem with heat curling when printing large documents.
Great organizer, but the two compartments on the right aren't quite wide enough for my tastes.  
I bought another one because it looked slightly different but it was a cosmetic change only, the product quality is still zero.
This is a good pen at a good price.
These work great!  
This is a good all-purpose paper for your printer.
These dividers are good for general use.
HP means the product is good - but not having to drive also adds to the convenience - fair price as well.
This is a nice pen, it looks nice and writes nice.
Original review: Great scientific calculator for my college students.  
I use it to keep my paper shredder in good working condition.  
Will not work with my Logitech wireless mouse.
My wife bought this for a college class that required it.
They're cute without being too dramatic/distracting!
The back of the notebook is super cute, as well.
They are binder clips and they run small.  
Certainly not like the Rolodexes I used to use... not too sturdy.
There are good 2 part carbon-less forms.  
Nice little calculator for the price and I like the choice of colors available.
Works great for a few pieces of paper at a time.
What a perfect combination for the dorm!
If you're punching holes for badge straps, expect it to come apart pretty easily.
Never jam in the printer.
Great product, great price, fast shipping!
Avery makes a very good product and I recommend them to those who are on tight budgets.
Works fine, slightly larger than credit card size
The angle of your eye to display needs to be adjusted then you see well.
Most mouse pads I have seen have a larger surface area for the mouse to move on, but so far that has not seemed to be a noticeable problem in use.
Had this cartridge for several years now and printed hundreds of pages still going strong, no issues with lines or streaks on the pages.  Would recommend.
Little bigger than I thought it would be, but thats a good thing.
These are great.
Superb Belkin quality.
I have this on my desk and it is very, very useful -- holds a lot of stuff.
Great tape.
No problems putting it up, works great, highly recommend!
This one was worth the money, is easy to read.
It kills insects.
Don't clip as well as some others I have.
Works very well, found lots of nuts, bolts and metal in my yard.  
My old Remington cuts like a champ again!  
I recommend that you put it far away from your patio & doors because it will attract the flies to the area that you have it.
I liked this nozzle so much that I immediately order another one.  
Using a regular, or even "grill size" spatulas makes a big mess of the fillets sometimes.
Other chemical repellents just don't seem to work all the time.
Just replacements for a couple I've already used.
Works just fine
Unable to use without transferring to another container.
I mean, a LOT!!  
Cuts way better!  
Very happy with my purchase.
It's been a reallyl wet summer, and I haven't had a bite!  
Adjusts easily and covers a large area.
I have been very pleased with this "easily stored away" container that is lightweight.  
We prefer safeguarding the health of these little birds rather than the supposed convenience of this product.
In the end it lookedO.K. but the light material makes me think that it may not last very long.
Your fruit and vegetables grow well with the additives but you must be carefull to use with appropriate proportions.
The low price of this makes it look like a great deal, but it is just money thrown away.  
Pros:Hot water went through it okDid not leak at spigotCons:Not very solidKinks easilyI'd seriously like to send it back.
Bigger than expected, which is good since it is easier to read.
Good deal, good price, does the job.
You need a sturdy handle to shovel snow over 2 inches deep, like you get when the snow plows the car with snow around the wheels.
My old feeders were getting brittle..
My local shop guys loves the manufacturer.
All-in-all my new favorite lawn care toy.
NOTHING compares to a grilled burger...
These pads are excellent as they do their job of trapping fleas and other tiny insects when used with the flea traps.
this is a very good product, fit my need very well, would recommend it to all users, thank you very much
I wish it was squirrel proof but that's not reality.  
Maybe this is the reason.
LOVE IT.
It uses a horrible odor to attract flies.
I really don't know the science behind these, but my pond is clear and if these have something to do with it i'm happy.  
Great product  easy to use in the drive or in the yard great to wash the truck or hose the driveway
I often read the reviews and think it is important for others to know the truth.
Great price, perfect shipping care and even better item.
BTW -  the charging cycle is a tad long, but I get good run time.
People who complain about this product must be trying to cut 1/2 inch branches with it because it is great for trimming bushes and hedges; makes the job so much easier than with the heavy wood-handled trimmers I had.  
My favorite rain gauge.  
It must be a sweet spot because it seems to have almost totally eliminated mosquitoes in the grassy parts (we don't go back in the woods much).
Good clean cuts every time.
Excellent item.
Good replacement and fast delivery.
It has great ingredients, and you can tell it doesn't feel dusty or full of shell bits like some cheap brands.  
I use one to clean the filter motor and nooks and crannies on the cat h2o  fountains.
It usually takes at least a month for them to get all the way through so it's an excellent buy for the money.  
I hope Wellness continues to keep the same formula for all their flavors since my cats love it so much.
These are my favorite perches for birds; they are soft on their feet, offer support and can be adjusted to fit wherever you want them.
I have found in the past a need for a back up just in case but not with this filter so far, Best price I found anywhere as well!
However, with a product like this, it should be easy to buy an unopened product with instructions, so I kept this as a 1-star review for that reason.
I ordered a brand new one and received  a used, dirty and disgusting filter.
Any fishkeeper worth  his or her salt understands the importance of healthy plants in a freshwater aquarium setting.  
Returned as I bought the wrong product.
The  springs eventually get weak but I'm ok with that as long as I get a few years.
The cats respected the scat mat at first but then figured out they could pee next to it so I would have to have wall to wall scat mats in order for it to work.
Their energy and behavior is like a 2 year old cat.  
Very happy with my purchase!
My dog will not eat this on his food no matter what I do.  
These dog treat are great and my pup loves them.
My dog loves this toy!
Snickers loves laying on her side batting the ball.  
We've given her a lot of different foods and this is the only one she is so fussy about!
We have two year old pit bull mixes and a 5 month old APBT.
My other kitty thinks it't a treat!
If you don't have carpet then it fits well in the bottom of his cat tree like it's one of the levels of play!I would highly recommend this to any cat owner that doesn't want to spend their money on gadgets that your cat may or may not have any interest in.  
Mr. Bill is my dog's favorite toy, hands down.
This stuff does nothing to remove stains or odor from dog urine on carpet!Please don't waste your money on this product!There are far better products out there that do a better job.
Probably handler area but the 25m launcher worked much better for me.
I'm happy.  
A must have for serious pond enthusiast
It is also super durable.
It's okay, the cats will eat it, but they are not crazy about it.  
But I do think this product will be better than FrontLine.
Plus its actually fortuitous because my bunnies love it, and I've replaced the much smaller one I had for them, which always seemed a tad small.
gravel only aquarium...
I know it says colors may vary but the mauve is awful.
I was nervous about spending so much and not knowing if my 2 dogs (lab and German Shepherd/Whippet mix) were gonna like this but they absolutely love it.  
aquatic turtles are wonderful pets (i have 2; big turtle & little turtle), but they are sure dirty.
My dog loved this...will be ordering more, for sure.
My dogs do not like these at all.
Cats like it.
This was a different gift for our dogs and they like chewing on them.  
It's a good price compared to what the pet store wants when you go in.
My sister rescued a grayhound and wiggles just loves this food and the loving new owners she has.
It does take a day or two to really see results.
Love this!  
Cats love it and the quality/ingredients are nearly perfect (first three ingredients should ALWAYS be meats -- not meat by-products, or water, or anything else).  
The plastic seems a bit stronger than the original which is never a bad thing for a replacement product from Hagen.
Otherwise, it has worked extremely well for our Lab puppy.
My dogs love these cookies best price on Amazon
Good size for a puppy.  
My dog's training essental
My female cat would not eat canned food so we let her keep eating Pro Plan's Weight Management dry food.
This is a great dog food
Works great and much cheaper than other brands.
When they are wet they feel just like a soft cotton cloth.
love coke and did not want to go to the store to get it that week due to illness.
LOVE the new design.  
Crunchy, Sweet, Yummy.  
good, filling and delicious.
Gentle scrubber
Smuckers is a good tasting jelly.
These are the best bread crumbs!
wonderful application and is almost instant.
on time delivery and good price!
don't make me puke...
The kitchen bags do their job: great smell.
So far I've noticed that my skin is clearer.
These bars are hard to find and they taste delicious.
I did not get any, my husband ate them all, so I suppose they where good, lol!
Water is less expensive at your local stores.
Good price.
As a beauty product, I mix VCO with CO+AO since CO+AO are my favorite oils for my skin.
Great right out of the can.  Will add to scrambled eggs when the weather cools enough to use the kitchen.
As good as sriracha gets.
My teeth are a bit whiter, but that could be mind over matter.
Very Salty!
Great deal.
Reasonable price for a necessary product.
He loves this stuff.
I tried these for routine clean ups and find them no more convenient, and less effective, than a good old cotton rag along with a squirt of your favorite multipurpose cleaner.
What to say about paper towels....
I like the shampoo, it has coconut in it, which makes my hair curl more, but it hydrates.
GREAT ON TOASTED WWBREAD AND TOMATO SOUP!
Love the original flavors and there's a lot of product.
Wish we could order more at this price.
Most comfortable tissue we have tried
I like the big refill, too.
I do love the immediate feel of glossiness and  thickness that you get tho.
really soft and gentle on a sore nose
best smelling stuff ever!
Bought this to use as a coffee creamer, big disappointment for that use as it took a ton of it and did not taste that great.  
I really do not like this scent.  
I loved this the first few times But now it seems too sweet, at least to east regularly.
Very happy to find this soup at the pantry at such a good price.
Not sure if I will buy these again...
good price for this size of fabric softener
Good price, smells nice.  
Its name brand food, its great.
It would be great if it tasted like freshly ground coffee, but it is still pretty good.
These are easy to close and see that the bag is closed.
Love this line of cleaning products... have purchased this multiple times... would recommend for a good cleaner without harsh chemicals
Its tuna people.  add on to pantry
just chill for the best taste.
I like the French style green beans they seem to taste better out of a can than regular green beans - a little crisper
This is a great feature, if you have some Divx video files, on your hard drive.  
my life is complete now thank you
Just read a few reviews, and then consider a Mac.
If you have a household full of phones and Kindles and PC's (maybe not Apple stuff) this is a very good choice.
The GPS unit picked up satellites quickly and easily, besting the GPS unit in my phone as well as a dedicated handheld Magellan unit I had brought for comparison.  
We still love and use our Windows-based version of Dragon, but the Mac version has quite a ways to go I think before it will be an equal player.
This is a great  learning Spanish software program for the visual learner.
If you like "painless" then you'll like Apple's software.  
Frankly, Norton anti-virus uses so much system resources it should be classified as bloatware, or even malware.
I wasn't a fan of the ribbon when MS first introduced that.  
Dragon for Mac is incredibly easy to use, and quite intuitive.
Good product.  
Because of that, the best thing you should be able to say about a product in this category is that it works.
Just as an aside,the satisfaction guarantee only applies to a tax issue.
I find the free TaxAct (taxact.com) actually more user-friendly and more flexible when you want to enter information on the forms yourself.
Do NOT buy this!
On a ranch, everyone pitches in.
Protection is not created equal across all devices.
The speed improvements are tremendous.
After installing my usual crossword pages, like cnn games would no longer load.
It's also a wonderful budgetting tool, comparing itself to Quicken.
This would be a perfect program for an elementary classroom.
In addition, the family license is broad and doesn't freak out if you install in multiple devices.
Lovely system - works as advertised -- be sure that this is a system you can afford the monthly charges for.
Been using for 15 + years.
My needs are pretty basic:  protect the computer/network (as well as my colleagues to whom I sent emails and documents), and not be intrusive in my work.
Not at all.  
Always purchase at a discount.  
It's a big miss for the Office team.
It is great and I like it better than Turbo tax.
For DVD movies and DVD-R discs, this software worksgreat.  
These guys serriosuly need to advertise better.  
Deleted it.
A program that is fairly easy to use and provides some good results.
Would not install on windows 8.1, and after trying to talk to their tech support, or lack there of, I returned it for a refund
Keep my keyboard protected
Highly recommend.
Final Cut Express is your bridge to serious video editing.  
I like OmniPage very much.
I was moving up to Office 2016 from Office 2007 so it is a major change for me.  
The other software tools they have are also very handy if you have a need.
This is a very good product at a price much lower than the other "big" tax preparation software company.  
Downloads no problem and protects my computer, couldn't ask for more.
I was not unnerved like a lot of the kids playing this game were, so the "Haunted" aspect fell flat on me.  
But, this was one fantastic deal.  
easy way to update my sony bravia that is 60 feet from my modem/router.
To be honest I've always been a Photoshop fan.
Will continue to buy especially with great price at Amazon if you keep watching.
I choose this rating because I know this product and the Company behind it's development.  
Great lookDoes not work at windows site for upgrades.
The best tennis ball...maintain pressure and most durable.
Great quality compared to the competion.
I put one of these on my shotgun and one on my Marlin 336.  
It is a nice gimmick
This was like a slip and slide from day one.
Not liken this helmet im going to go to my local bike shop and get a better one for my cycling
It's wonderful to find what I need for therapy on Amazon.
Nice, should work really well
We really like these gloves for hitting on the heavy bag
Nothing fancy but it works and very inexpensive to boot
Received asvexpected
piece of crap bent the first time i put it on the bike but only $5 so i didn't even bother returning it
And even though it was made for 4 bikes, they all had to be adult bikes as it isn't designed to hold kids bikes.
Great little tent and well made.  
Easy to set up, clean and pack away.
I love mountain house food and I love this macaroni and cheese!  
Surprisingly warm.  
A perfectly well made piece of bike bling.
Very easy to see where your bullets are hitting, because it turns florescent green around the bullet impact.
Good value for the price.
This is our grandson's favorite basketball so when it "disappeared" during a tournament, I promised I'd get him another one.  
Quite strong, a bit stronger than I was expecting and it doesn't stay on as well as I would hope for something so tight.
I have tried various pairs of swim goggles but these Speedos are the only ones which do not end up leaking and letting the water in.
I think they make the same hatchet for Gerber as well.
It has made our basement  game room that much more fun!  
Didn't buy these for playing, but for the dryer.  
the 1" won't fit.
Really like these, but  was surprised by the smallness of the dots.
Overall, this is a good product and the price was tough to beat (less than half the price of my local sporting goods store).
follow the workout charts they give you.
works very well
This is a very good product: simple in design but ample in performance.
I threw this thing and one time decided to try forehand throw and i flung it 200+ yards.
Background: I've been going to the gym for at least 10 years.
Love the fold-down function for transporting.
I bought this for my grandson to get him ready for his first camping experience - and I wanted him to be super warm.
Great product, highly recommended!
Definitely buy again
Top shelf boat galley food!
This goal was very easy to set up and easy to move around the yard.
Looks pretty authentic.
I love it!Now, even though I originally wanted it for emergency situations, I can see using it to cook for picnics or just be outside on hot days.
I like this helmet.
The taste of 99% of the mountain house meals i've had is delightful.
The typical stock seat post is made with stamped steel and has a single pivoting adjustment point.  
We have had to take it to the bike shop dozens of times for realignment.
The optics are very clear, easy to set, (and once set you don't have to keep changing them.)Flat black, no glare, easy to set up, Instructions are foolproof.  
The yello wis really great for lower light days, as it pops on the water and attracts a lot of attention.
Can't wait to get them!
It fits like a glove, once adjusted.  
Easy to use and very versatile.
(So, I can't comment on jam fixes, but it is easy to remove the nosepiece, without tools.)  
This unit is super reliable, light to hold, and easy to manipulate.
I got this for electric throws for the couch in the livingroom.  
I buy the original bags because they make for dust free vacuuming.
It works fine with 220.  
You can't buy a better rip blade.
Not as bright as I'd like it to be.
In my opinion, Freud blades and router bits are the best.
Once both pedals are locked, it is very easy to maneuver the drill press.
These are great all-purpose locks that are specifically good for applications where the lock might be in contact with the dirt (like a manhole cover) because it has the durable rubber cover to keep the dirt out.  
For making square pieces (doors, frame panels, boxes, etc) these clamps are the best.  
Excellent  product and fast shipping  thanks
The base assembly is easy and works much better than some other designs.  

Excellent service on the sale as well.
My Kreg jig is one of my most used tools.
I bought the Park Tools version and they are perfect.
Great tool!  
I keep it fitted permanently to my Dremel.
A very well made set of trammel pointsYou won't be disappointed with these trammels
Works great on PVC and small cuts.  
Ladies should be happy about that one though....
fixed my leak under sink myself
This makes for an invisible, and well not quite bullet proof, and very sturdy joint.
Feels good in the hand.  
I know it's rid to spend the money on this
With its needle point and tapered design, it is intended for fine work.
Nice feature.  
Happy climbing . . .
I got this to go with my work station.  
Great quality comes with the Channellock name.
exactly as expected
Excellent price and item!!!
Other reviewers on this site have noted this (and I wish I'd read their reviews before buying the saw!).
My unit keeps cycling and won't hold pressure.
Great tool for deburring soft copper lines after cutting.
This glue joint bit is excellent for aligning board surfaces.
Had to shave PVC conduit tubes on back
It's a great product and works better than advertised, but I just wish they made it easier to go from tone-to-tone.
This is a nice filter and I have used these in the past on my Shop-Vac and they hold up well.
Saw blade is very sharp, very useful.
Perfect accessory for your Dremel when you are working with smaller works for precision detail.  
Long ship time and high cost compared to just doing to the hardware store.
My second set.
It hasn't broke YET, but i do not feel as though it is impact adequate.
Its kind of flimsy so I wouldnt put this out where it will get beat by the wind or southern sun, but under a carport it works just fine.
Good quality.
I have cut nothing but hardwood molding (actually most molding is Luan), so pretty soft stuff.
Pretty useless - I can buy better quality disposable for a dollar or so.  
great set of dominos.  
I love love Abacus, there is a reason it was the first tool used to teach Math.
I like that this is more than just start and race to the finish.
Great for travel and fine motor skills.
What more could I ask for in a colored pencil for pre-schoolers?
I can't get this put together.  
I love the extra pieces that completed this crane.  
It is surprisingly awesome for everyone walking by!
These magnetic poetry kits are fantastic for keeping on the fridge.  
It's just a fun thing to do in the mornings and evenings to help practice memorizing his numbers.
old loves it too.  
My daughter loves playing this
Nice selection of paint for kid's artwork.
Good buy!
Some are practical jokes, others are strange facts.
Overall though it is a very cool tub.
Adequate, but not great.
Easy and fun game.
My daughter says that she loves to play with it.  
I've learned quite a few interesting dinosaur names now, too. ;)
My son loves this thing.
A great learning toy!
I don't like the fact that you can't tuck the blankets in that way so it literally is like sleeping in a tent versus on a made bed.
This is not like the game I grew up with.
This toy is sturdy and strong and takes everything my one year old does with it.
My daughter is 10 months old and I bought this for her thinking she would like it.  
I was very disappointed when I opened the package.
Just as described.
A good old fashioned classic toy.  
It's a great game to play at parties since it's basically a quicker version of Scrabble.  
Our five and six year old think it's the best game ever.
It has made our daily walks much nicer as the kids aren't sitting in the sun the whole way.  
Each figure has very nice detail and a super cute face.
This is the best gift ever for a new walker!!!  
It comes in a wooden box to carry your pizza and all its toppings in makes it easy for us to carry around.
This thing is creepy...
My 5-year-old has learned something quite valuable through this toy, which is well made.
My 15 month old son is terrified of the duck and refuses to go in it.  
The letters are also not cut out with very good quality.  
The trucks seem like they are good quality and my son love it.  
Makes for an interesting and fun colored interaction - trains and blocks!very happy!
What can I say, this is a toy that kids have to have.  
So, all in all, a fun accessory to observe bugs; but also an opportunity for the little ones to think things through and learn about other living creatures around them.
Great colors, Easy to use.  
Well worth the money!
We've used the science kits and they have been great.
Excellent choice.
I can't believe how much better quality this kitchen is in comparison!  
Like other Melissa & Doug toys, the "Shape, Model & Mold" set is an outstanding concept that could use some refinement.  
Had a lot of fun with the family playing this game!
The fighter class is by far the best one to go with.
When it comes to buying a GBA, i recommend getting the SP.
I've missed playing this game so much, glad to have it back in my collection.
Rather than giving us a "living, breathing world to explore", the actualy in-game world is completely linear.
One of the best fighters ever made, actually quite possible the best fighter ever made thus far.
Nascar Thunder 2004 is the latest in the series of Nascar games.
They really packed some serious fun into this game, and i know i'll be playing it for a very very long time.
The game gives you some excellent audio effects.
perfect for those great Capcom and import titles!
It is not true that this game is the best FPS game ever made, infact it doesn't even come close.
The puzzles were very "real" and by real
Truly a classic game that is a must for n64 collection.
Oh well it's still a good game.
THIS IS PERHAPS THE BEST CASTLEVANIA GAME EVER MADE!
Blizzard knows how to put the right elements in a game to give it wonderful replayability.
This is a GREAT game!
like the big snake boss which scared the hell out of me.
I've been wanting one of these for a while.
I remember having this joystick when I was a little kid, I brought myself another one 2 years ago & it's still fun til this day
Probably not; that is unless they were looking for a good laugh or two.
I recommend this game to gamers who don't really have anything to do, and are just looking for a cute game to waste their time playing.
This is still, to me anyway, the best game of the series.
This game was a pleasant surprize.
This game is best enjoyed by your seven-year old nephew who does not have a grasp of the destuctiveness of modern weapons.  
The best graphics on the NES.It has Mike Tyson c'mon.!!!!!Ohhh that music.
I first played this on PC and i enjoy it, then i played it for XBOX not much the same expereince but still liked playing it...GOOD PLAY
The characters are highly detailed and the level design is wonderful.  
Is that pretty much the entire game was based of the movie "Bloodsport" with Jean Claude Van Damme.
This is a great game!
Great planes, outstanding graphics and great details.
Do not pass this one up!!
Very fun Sim game, probably not for hardcore Sim players, but good for many hours of relaxing fun...even when you let the dinosaus eat the tourists.  
It's a pretty wild ride.
Great stick, this thing does it all.
This game sucks.
A hero loved by the people (or villains)?
I ordered mine for $35 because I saw it as an unbelievably good deal.
The best one, to me, being the Adventure mode.
Livin' Large is a big improvement to the original Sims.  
Definitely an old favorite of mine.
Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick (Silver/Black)...; Price vs quality this is a great product.  
Sonic Spinball: if you love pinball video games you might like this one.  
If you like the Spyro and Crash games, you'll love this one.
Arguably the best game ever made.
While not better than those superb titles, it IS better than the overhyped Sega GT, providing a better balance than that still-good game ultimately manages.
This game might be good for kids learning to play video games, although it is violent.  
This games story is great, but unfortunately the game play is not.
My most favorite was Raven.  
You have the long term and daily meters, which means it takes longer to make good friends or fall in love.  
and I actually caught myself pretty immersed into it at times.
