Great book!
I didn't appreciate the small print sizes
Enjoyable but a little far fetched for its time
a tale like this as well as Hemingway
The KJV bible very well made purchased
The story of Dr.
still strong
I wish he would stick with the main characters
The adventures seemed really taken from the lives of people
Hang in there, and it will get better
A great little book
My attention was kidnapped by the unfolding story
Excellent set, worth the read and money
I am talking about CHAPTER after CHAPTER...
A good story, Clancy-style, and well written.
I had a very hard time relating to the characters

Well written.
Why is everything wrong?
I've read a printed version of Little Women
I got some new ideas but it was mostly...
They are certainly a favorite of mine
It was missing the beginning of the story
It was freakin awesome
waisted and could of been combined with the last book of the Harte saga
A close knit family and how newcomers are welcomed into the fold
The continuing exploits of Fitz/Tom keep you entertained
It's different now!
A book full of twists and turns
The best Clancy book written
Good book for a smaller group of characters

The play is set in Scotland.
A detective and the town sheriff investigate
This book is really much better than a reference
It meanders a bit, and...
It is well worth your time to read and reflect
I read his book prior to the movie
*HIGHLY RECOMMEND*
Clancy is a bad writer
It's a hoot to read
Book as advertised
I did lose interest after about the fourth page...
Lewis is brilliant and...
Clancy is not an economist, and the book really drags when he spends pages at a stretch [...]
Very good book
This will be a fun story to follow
Better for transition into movie scripts
William Shakespeare's tragic play
Glad I did.
Very slow book.
Interesting and informative introduction
Great book set and a wonderful price!
MaryHiggins Clark did not lose their touch with this story!
Very boring character.
They were in good enough condition to give

This book is so vague that you may as well consult a magic 8-ball for guidance
It was a gift
The slower pacing of this book...
Excellent read
A nice gift or coffee table book
The typical Sidney Sheldon story
Really tense action sequences
Saw the movie first do I had to read the book

I became a Lenny Kravitz fan the moment I heard the song
I'm glad that I own this SACD

A great bargain for the price
Don't be too quick to judge an album
what an awesome melodic death doomy metal album
The drumming sounds like a worker hammering onto a metal bar

Rush live is better than most bands and...
The best Beatles covers
This is still my favorite offering by these German rockers
I don't think the dance music here is very genius

bought the 2015 vinyl edition, musically is perfect but the sound,...
Great Queen tune
This was their first trademark rock anthem
Iommi's guitar solo
This is the Titanic
Haunting vocals, driving rhythms, and a musical purity all unite

The sound is countryish and...
The eden dvd is wonderful
It belongs in every bluegrass fan's collection.

Good album.
BORN UNDER A BAD SIGN
The only choice I even might quibble about is the last track, and even that one is pretty good

This is an often overlooked band that every rock fan should check out.
That everyone is playing from their own soul level
THis is not real...
A soft sassy little number with gentle undertones
Safan utilizes a triumphant fanfare to develop the main theme
A classic from start to finish
If you can appreciate some random musical
Timeless music, unforgotten sounds like Ayers reminds you when artist put real craft & skills in the product
A boring album filler

This is his debut solo album
